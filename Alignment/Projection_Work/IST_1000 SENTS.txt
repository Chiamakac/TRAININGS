come to the fore several years ago, not just a few months ago and give us great interest.\nIt has literally meant something\nOmoyele Sowore\nBBC\nThe President of the African Democratic Congress, Ralph Nwosu, has slammed the fruits of his democratic rhetoric and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, and described it as a result of the collapse of his democracy.\nSowore was arraigned by the State Department of Justice at the Federal High Court last Friday, less than 24 hours after his release.\nThe practice has been criticized by local and international authorities but the Nigerian government says it is not affected.\nIn an interview with PUNCH, Nwosu said, \"what happened in court was a clear indication of the failure of democracy.\nThey have seen the show that has been coming to us for many years, not just a few months ago and is of great interest to us.\nit has come out in full.\nWhen dictatorships begin, there will be many subtleties to guide the people, but when they come to fruition, problems arise.\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Banky-W described Nigeria as a country proud of torturing innocent people.\nHe said, \"I am only grateful for the way our court has acted properly by releasing Omoyele Sowore.\nNigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and destroying the power, the will and the hope of the people,\nEvery time our leaders do wrong and pass away, our hearts go out to them\nwe are helpless, hopeless, we accept that it is so unknown, but there is nothing we can say or do to change it\n\"You do not have to be a candidate or a volunteer for Sowore to ensure that human rights and justice are not compromised.\nThe right to free speech and the right to freedom of movement are the fundamental rights of every Nigerian\nMay God bless all those in our legislature who are on the right side of the story by doing good\nMay God encourage, comfort and bless Sowore, his wife and his family as they go through these bad days only to find themselves guilty of trying to talk about the future of Nigeria.\nSowore is our winner, not a criminal-Ondo student\nIrinyemi said Sowore's Foundation for Free Literacy, which has helped many parents send their children to school, has been in place since its inception by the DSS.\nA school in Ondo State has gone on a protest march for the arrest of a pro-democracy activist, and Sahara Protestant publisher, Omoyele Sowore, by the State Department.\nstudents, according to the Kiribo Students' Union, said Sowore's arrest was to be condemned by Nigerian lovers\nThe protesters marched on the town of Idepe under the Okitipupa administration of the state, chanting slogans and demanding the release of Sowore, who has provided them with free education for many years to date.\nAccording to the students, the declaration of Sowore and Olawale Bakare as 'prisoners of conscience' by Amnesty International, shows that the internationally-recognized pro-democracy activist is known as one of the few Africans known as activists.\nA spokesman for the student protesters, Samuel Irinyemi, told the Sahara Protesters that many of them were beneficiaries of Sowore's free education who were being held hostage.\nHe called on President Muhammadu Buhari to abide by the court order by ordering security forces to release Sowore to his family.\nIrinyemi, \"we are just a few of the many students who receive free scholarships from Omoyele Sowore Foundation for Free Education in Ondo State\nwe are unhappy that our brother and the eldest we are benefiting from is the one who died and was in the hands of the DSS on hate

For example, the fall of the International Military Task Force Base, the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, which was overseen by a military commander, who was very vocal, not in the fall of the venue but n 'due to the large number of military equipment only to hand in hand with the existing equipment to the military in Maiduguri to ISWAP.\nCriminals are already winning and are motivated in a way that threatens the military.\nAccording to a complaint we received from AFP, there has never been such a riot in the North East that has put the Nigerian military in trouble as it is now in the hands of criminals only in 2018.\nAs a result of the escalation of the heart attack, Chad Basin's economic restructuring plan provided for fishing, full-time farming, water, land cross-border trade, the criminals remained firm.\nit is understood, they have welcomed new troops both English-speaking and French-speaking countries and surrounding countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.\nThe information coming in from ISWAP indicates a further challenge to the authorities and the military in capturing the country.\nISWAP considers the Northern and Central Borno regions as their own. The Nigerian military presence at the military base has been taken as high as that of those who have been forcibly removed by the military.\nWaiting for their time to acquire equipment along with the lifting of their spirits to quell the unrest, the team was willing to spend several years researching before they marched.\nTheir optimism came true in 2018.\nThey have been in trouble all year 2018.

{"text":"Named Nigeria in Hadeja, Jigawa state has a strong market presence in the Niger Republic.\nSoldiers can take their product from their customers, take away their training and satisfy themselves rather than devising ways to resist their own business.\nIt now appears that more countries are joining ISWAP than the military.\nISWAP wants to make it less attractive and more expensive by the number of people and the use of equipment that the military will use to protect those cities.\nThey have calculated and concluded that as they attack the army that will put them back on the ground, which will convince the locals that they will be safer under them than under the Nigerian army.\nhowever, they have decided that they will continue to fight for the army until it is too late for those who have been discouraged to pursue them sooner rather than later.\nRoad works and tours of the 2018 military year, does it work?\nEvidence of ISWAP military attacks in 2018 on their territory is 70%.\nWhat this means is that out of 20 military bases, ISWAP has expelled or closed military operations in 14 military bases alone in 2018.\nThe only time such a figure has occurred in 2018 is in 2014.\nby the end of 2015, there had been a 50 per cent victory, which ended in 2016 and 2017, and had its worst in 2018.\nThe scene and the map of the aftermath of the terrible war.\nThe area bordering Mount Borno is under the jurisdiction of Mount Maiduguri and is bordered by three countries including the Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\nISWAP has been strong in these countries.\nCentral Borno has eight sub-districts, but ISWAP and Boko Haram are strongest in these areas.\nSouth Borno is made up of nine sub-states with little influence, with the exception of towns such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok.\nWith about 45 days to go before the presidential election, it appears that there is a security breach at work to cover up the crisis rather than accept it.\nThe military has specifically said that ISWAP may but has not captured key operations where it has been strong, especially in the city of Baga.\nISWAP, on the other hand, was right when it said it had chased down militants in areas it had attacked, including Baga.\nNeither the military nor the criminals can seize and control the vast land.\nBut while they do not want to build a tower in the area they like, ISWAP has come a long way for the military to find it.\nOn the other hand, by claiming that its workers are local, the army has won only by making them ducks and easy enemies to attack.\nClearly, ISWAP is no longer interested in taking over military bases like the one in Baga and staying there. E\nthe house does not plan them at all.\nWhat impressed them the most was taking weapons in those areas and instilling fear in the troops which made it difficult for the troops to support the fighting.\nFor example, two days after the attack on Baga, ISWAP fighters left and took their weapons. From a reliable source, their aim is not to seize and take over the army, the ISWAP's favorite is to drive the troops from their positions to the border with Chad.\nThere is no better indication of the ISWAP's tactics against the military than to ensure that the Nigerian military is in a state of turmoil so that it is unable to carry out its mission. instead, they are in different places waiting for another day of attack.\nthe problem is the small army there.\nFor example, in one of the detention centers in Jos, Plateau state, there were more than a dozen military barracks left behind.\nSimilarly, militants who want to escape are those who have been captured by military equipment in the country.\nin the extreme embarrassment of the situation, military leaders are hiding such things.\nThe soldier in the hospital lamented that the soldiers had been lost.\nHe said many militants had been killed in action by Boko Haram.\nI would count many people who have been bombed by my own generation since they hid their assault.\nPolice are seeing the same thing so that 120 workers have been ambushed as they hear that they have been taken into custody.\nPresident Ibrahim Idris, according to Premium TImes on December 28, 2018, spoke out against the ban.\n\"The police are very kind to their superiors for chasing them. We are not fortunate because when we wanted to hide, we were arrested and we were not tried for several months,\" said one soldier arrested by the Special Task Force. (STF) in Jos.\nHe was arrested after he and his group slipped forward\nA courageous front-runner who spoke to our reporters about their situation praised their troops for their resilience on a number of occasions.\nHe said that unlike the terrorists, the military does not use video cameras to fight to escape their bullets.\nAccording to him, there were more attacks on military bases by the terrorists than by those in the area.\n\"Players go to the polls on television, where we, as a rule, do not do this.\n\"Nevertheless, he urged Nigerians not to pay attention to the number of crimes we have committed. The killings of civilians are in our hearts. troops continue to die, Nigeria may cross, \"he concluded\nmany of the attacks were so great that many military bases were badly damaged.\nAccording to media reports, at least 1,000 soldiers have been killed in 2018.\nThe death toll does not include those killed in the Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and West Borno.\nOf course, there has never been a year in which soldiers were killed as much as in 2018, not in 2013 and 2014 we did not see the kind of massacre we have seen so far, \"said a military doctor in Maiduguri.\nTo make matters worse for the military, through ISWAP, the threat posed by the captives was to teach them how to fight with modern technology before enslaving or killing them.\nThe official source said that the battlefield in Monguno was the only one operating outside of Maiduguri that had not been harmed.\nFour or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, where Damasak is a joint force with the Niger Republic.","entities":{"Date":[{"indices":[877,881],"kind":"date","rule":"TempYear2","ruleFinal":"YearOnlyFinal","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[949,953],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[1083,1085],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date"},{"indices":[1110,1114],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[1160,1164],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[1171,1175],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3238,3262]},{"indices":[1191,1195],"kind":"date","rule":"TempYear2","ruleFinal":"YearOnlyFinal"},{"indices":[1250,1254],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date"},{"indices":[1259,1263],"kind":"date","rule":"TempYear2","ruleFinal":"YearOnlyFinal"},{"indices":[1286,1290],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[4125,4142],"rule":"DateNameRev","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date"},{"indices":[5255,5259],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[5442,5446],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date","matches":[3233,3234,3236,3237,3242,3257,3260]},{"indices":[5455,5459],"rule":"YearContext1","ruleFinal":"DateOnlyFinal","kind":"date"},{"indices":[5464,5468],"kind":"date","rule":"TempYear2","ruleFinal":"YearOnlyFinal","matches":[3238,3262]}],"Location":[{"indices":[6,13],"name":"The
