I understand if you are satisfied with your salary, three bedroom flat and used SUV and as a result have no dreams for the country of your birth.
I personally have a dream for Nigeria and so does many other citizens like Omoyele Sowore, who are frustrated and opinionated.
To seek a revolution without carrying fire arms or taking steps to overthrow government is not and can never be a crime.
To seek to raise the consciousness of the citizens by asking them to demand change is never a crime.
That is why democracy as a system of government is defined as "government of the people, by the people and for the people" and not government of tyranny, by a tyrant and for the slaves.
If protesting and calling the protest #RevolutionNow were a crime, the courts should have been able to convict Omoyele Sowore after keeping him for over 120 days.
So, please note that your abstinence and silence from national issues of injustices, corruption and poor public services delivery does not make you a better person.
You are just myopic and damn too selfish.
You see, I am writing this piece because someone said to me that I should leave Sowore’s matter alone and face my business on WhatsApp and I laughed.
He will be reading this post so I have decided to grant him the anonymous identity as his view remain myopic in my own opinion.
For you, who is reading now, be reminded that the idea around the statement when you are told to "mind your business" is not just to sell your products and services.
It is also to show interest in your country and speak out against injustices and the violation of the social contract, at least, on a need to say basis.
If your country becomes a banana republic where people are kidnapped in the courts of law in broad day light, what will happen to your business and your plans to partner with global brands?
Every serious business generates an annual report at the end of each year that includes taking a look at the technological, political, social and economic environment in which it operates.
This skill of environmental scanning, which is necessary for writing such a report is primarily the duty of a sound public relations practitioner, who has the knowledge, skill and attitude to research happenings and developments in the society and report same to management and leadership of the organisation or the client he serves for effective planning purposes.
Yes, this helps for planning and carrying stakeholders along in business projections and the possible benefits of occurrences in the business environment as well as the possible dangers ahead for a free market economy.
It is not “tush" or "classy" to operate like you are immune from the developments in the environment in which you operate and live.
For instance, based on the poor medical services in the country today, if anybody at all gets involved in a minor accident or contracts a minor disease that should be otherwise curable and manageable where effective and efficient medical services exist, such may result into the death of the victim.
As impunity becomes a culture reminiscent of 1984, let me state very clearly that a genuine foreign investor will definitely be scared of coming to do business in Nigeria knowing full well that if a well-respected citizen and prominent leader like Omoyele Sowore can be abducted in the law courts, anything can sure happen to him or her as well as his or her investments.
If you add this to the myriad of unsolved criminal cases of fraud, kidnapping, terrorist bombing and the absence of efficient and effective public services, how exactly do you expect a young millionaire in Monaco, who sees opportunities for long-term investment in Nigeria to so want to?
So, when you think that keeping quiet is a matter of sophistry and status symbol, I beg to disagree.
How exactly is it a matter of class or civilisation to keep quiet in the face of injustice?
One of the greatest dangers for any business is the violation of the rule of law and the principles of justice, equality and the right to be heard.
Businesses thrive best where the rule of law is respected and the justice system is well established to serve the general public without fear or favour.
For the avoidance of doubt, here are the few things among many others that a businessman or woman thinks about before investing outside his country of birth:
1. Political stability, personal and property rights.
2. Labour skills.
3. Tax rates.
4. Transport and infrastructure.
5. Size of economy and potential for growth.
Without disregard for number 2 to 4, let me say very clearly that no businessman will leave his country in pursuit of profit if the other four items on the list are guaranteed where the first on the list isn't.
The very first item on the list touches directly on the gross injustices against Omoyele Sowore and his supporters and clearly sends a sharp message of disregard for the rule of law and the issue of personal and property tights.
Therefore, I think that the government should look into this matter and think of us businessmen, who are trying to partner other companies with greater capacities for partnership and the clear purpose of creating wealth as well as employment opportunities for the over 30 million young Nigerian roaming the country aimlessly.

Orji Kalu’s Properties Marked By EFCC Over N7bn Fraud
According to a statement by spokesperson for the agency, Wilson Uwujaren, the marking of the properties followed the December 5, 2019 order of Justice Muhammed Idris sitting at the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos.
Anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has marked properties belonging to a former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu.
According to a statement by spokesperson for the agency, Wilson Uwujaren, the marking of the properties followed the December 5, 2019 order of Justice Muhammed Idris sitting at the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos.
The Sun newspaper and Slok Nigeria Ltd are among Kalu’s properties marked by the EFCC.
The former Abia State governor, who is currently serving a 12-year jail term, is facing prosecution over N7.5bn belonging to the state he misappropriated while presiding over the affairs of the state.
As Orji Uzor Kalu Goes To Jail, FFK And Patience Jonathan Should Be Next By Churchill Okonkwo
Finally, as Senator Kalu goes to prison, the cases against Femi Fani-Kayode, Patience Jonathan and Tinubu should be expedited. 
If convicted, they should be made to refund all monies accumulated through corrupt means and made to enjoy a couple of years in jail. 
That is the real first step to purge the Nigerian system of endemic corruption.
The crucial element that has been missing in the fight against corruption in Nigeria is the absence of a high-profile conviction that will deter offenders from engaging in corrupt acts. 
And what better way is there to cross that threshold than sending one of the symbols of corruption in Nigeria in the 4th Republic, Orji Uzor Kalu, to prison.
With this conviction, which, hopefully, will be upheld by higher courts, you can now understand why those of us that voted for President Muhammadu Buhari, though disappointed with the lackluster start in the fight against corruption, are tickled. 
Though we are thrilled, we are also cautiously optimistic, conscious of the fact that tackling corruption in this present Nigeria is a tall order.
However, we are confident that the right steps can and should be taken to convict other high profile political elites like Bola Tinubu, Patience Jonathan, Olisa Metu, Femi Fani-Kayode, and co.
Before Orji Uzor Kalu joined the All Progressives Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, he turned Abia State to a wasteland. 
He gave Abia State the worst governor in the fourth Republic in the person of Theodore Orji.
What is interesting in this case is that Orji Uzor Kalu claimed in a Facebook message that he joined the APC because “Buhari personally promised me that all the contractors in the South-East will return to sites before the end of November.
I joined the APC because President Buhari has fulfilled the promise he made to me and we are hopeful he will do more.”
As a reward for joining the APC, President Buhari awarded several Federal Road contracts to his construction firm SLOK Holding. 
Also, the Niger Delta Development Commission recently awarded and funded SLOK Holdings to reconstruct the Umuahia-Uzuakoli Road as well as Uzuakoli-Ozuitem Road.
Unfortunately for Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, his court case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission did not drag out forever as he expected. 
With this conviction, too, his 2023 APC Presidential ambition is now dead. 
With this conviction, too, Nigerian are expecting the light of the fight against corruption to be turned on in the dark alleys on all pending corruption cases against former and serving public officials.
Now that Kalu is going to prison, the likes of Tinubu, Patience Jonathan, Olisa Metu, Femi Fani-Kayode should be made to account for their stewardship in public office. 
Sending Senator Kalu to prison will also, hopefully, deter Buhari’s aides from engaging in corrupt acts.
With the conviction of Kalu, Nigerians are expecting and demanding for the recovery of the $1.1bn paid to the London account of Malabu Oil and Gas by Goodluck Jonathan. 
A court of competent jurisdiction recently ordered the final forfeiture of N9.2m and $8.4m belonging to Patience Jonathan, wife of former President Goodluck Jonathan. 
The question for EFCC is why did they not ask the judge to put her in jail for enriching herself through corrupt means?
Mrs. Jonathan had ridiculously claimed that the monies were proceeds of goodwill donations from Nigerians, which she enjoyed as wife of a deputy governor, governor, and president. 
What a joke.
It is also a big joke that the EFCC is not taking seriously the petition against Tinubu’s display of two cash-laden bullion vans on his premises on the eve of the 2019 Presidential election in February. 
Is EFCC afraid of investigating Tinubu for money laundering?
Also, the N4.6bn money laundering case preferred against Fani-Kayode, who was Director of Publicity to the Goodluck Jonathan Presidential Campaign Organisation in 2015 has been dragging on forever. 
Why are these high-profile cases still pending?
Our courts have been sending petty thieves to jail every day. 
So, it’s not a case of the judicial system. 
Rather, it is a case of corrupt judges, Attorney-General, and others bribed to stupor that they turn a blind eye.
With Senator Kalu’s conviction however, the corruption cases of former governors (now distinguished senators) that has been ongoing for “eternity” should be expedited and offenders convicted and jailed. 
Most importantly, the EFCC should be re-organised and re-engineered as a matter of urgency.
Finally, as Senator Kalu goes to prison, the cases against Femi Fani-Kayode, Patience Jonathan and Tinubu should be expedited. 
If convicted, they should be made to refund all monies accumulated through corrupt means and made to enjoy a couple of years in jail. 
That is the real first step to purge the Nigerian system of endemic corruption.

Oshiomhole Goofed: Standard Chartered Bank Says It's Not A South African Firm
However, Standard Chartered told SaharaReporters: “Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria Limited is fully owned by Standard Chartered Plc, a British group.
Standard Chartered Bank has refuted a claim by Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of Nigeria's ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, that it is a South African company.
Oshiomhole, who spoke on the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals in South Africa, urged the Nigerian government to take over all South African firms in the country including Standard Chartered.
Oshiomhole had said, “We also know that Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic Bank, are all South African banks, Nigerians may have more shares there if any. 
It is time to ask them to wind up so that Nigerian banks will take advantage of their departure and expand their operations. We have enough to save by transferring these businesses to Nigerians.”
However, Standard Chartered told SaharaReporters: “Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria Limited is fully owned by Standard Chartered Plc, a British group.
“Standard Chartered PLC is a leading international bank, listed on the London, Hong Kong, and Mumbai stock exchanges.
“It has operated for over 150 years in some of the world's most dynamic markets and earns more than 90 per cent of its income and profits in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
“This geographic focus and commitment to developing deep relationships with clients and customers have driven the bank’s growth in recent years.”
Osun Government Shuts Down School Over Teachers, Students Clash
It was gathered that some students and teachers in the school engaged in physical fight, wielding cutlasses and sticks, a situation that caused tension in the area.
The Osun State government has ordered the immediate closure of Baptist High School, Gbodofon, Osogbo, after some irate students engaged teachers in physical duel and vandalised school properties, according to TheFlash, a local newspaper.
Commissioner for Education, Mr Oladoyin Folorunsho, gave the order while inspecting the school to assess the level of damage by the students.
It was gathered that some students and teachers in the school engaged in physical fight, wielding cutlasses and sticks, a situation that caused tension in the area.
A student, who pleaded anonymity, told journalists that the duel started last week Wednesday when some unknown students stormed the school.
He said, “We saw some students last week Wednesday in our school armed with machete and this made everyone to run for their lives.
“Although, hardly will a month pass that we don’t experience something like this and whenever such occurs, some of the irate students usually locked our teachers in their staff room.
“Last week Friday, they stormed our school again and some bold teachers confronted them which in turn led to the fight between the teachers and students.”
Oladoyin who expressed displeasure over the misconduct of the students ordered that the case be thoroughly investigated so that the perpetrators of the act will be brought to book.
He said that the estimated cost of the damages should be determined as the concerned students will be made to pay to serve as a lesson to others.
Our Reaction To Takeover Of Sowore's Case By Attorney-General Of Federation By Femi Falana
In view of the foregoing, we urge the AGF to file a nolle prosequi motion without any further delay to end the macabre dance, which has exposed the country to avoidable embarrassment.
It is not a takeover because it was the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abukabar Malami (SAN), that filed Omoyele Sowore's case and farmed it out to Dr Hassan Liman (San). 
But in view of the violent invasion of the court by armed operatives of the SSS, the AGF has decided to sack the prosecution team and have the case prosecuted by the DPP.
Having been advised that Sowore cannot be convicted on the basis of the proof of evidence filed in court, the SSS has refused to make the statements of the prosecution witnesses available to the defendants as ordered by the trial court. 
Hence, hearing in the case has been adjourned to February 20, 2020 at the instance of the prosecution.
Convinced that the pending case would collapse like a pack of cards, the SSS is currently fishing for evidence to nail Sowore. 
In spite of the directive of the AGF to take over the case, the SSS subjected Sowore to a four-hour interrogation on Thursday.
The entire interrogation pertained to Sowore's alleged links with the proscribed Boko Haram sect, IPOB and IMN, which he vehemently denied. 
At Sowore's instance, a member of the legal defence team, Mr Abubakar Marshal, witnessed the marathon interrogation. 
The plan of the SSS is to charge Sowore with terrorism in line with the unsubstituted allegations of presidential media aides.
In view of the foregoing, we urge the AGF to file a nolle prosequi motion without any further delay to end the macabre dance, which has exposed the country to avoidable embarrassment.
Peddlers Of Fake News Are Cowards, Says Soyinka
He also directed what appeared to be criticism at Obasanjo's support for Atiku's candidature.
Wole Soyinka, Nigeria’s only Nobel Laureate, says those who spread fake news are cowards and may need psychiatric evaluation.
He also directed what appeared to be criticism at Obasanjo's support for Atiku's candidature.
The literary icon spoke during a symposium in Abuja, on Wednesday, but did not directly mention neither Obasanjo nor Atiku, in his speech.
He questioned the former president's change of heart, which seemed to refer to Obasanjo's initial stance on his former vice-president.
His words: “We have got to develop very healthy scepticism. 
If someone in a position of power for eight years, has lectured a nation for eight years and after that continued year after year to continue to direct the minds of a whole nation in one direction only saying ‘this is Lucifer from hell’, for eight years in office and several more years out of office saying this is Lucifer and then one day he changed his left hand and says behold your redeemer, which of the two is fake news?”
Obasanjo had heavily criticized Atiku, who was his vice, during his eight years of presidency.
In his book titled ‘My Watch’, Obasanjo described Atiku as a “shameless liar”.
At a time, Obasanjo said God would never forgive him if he supports Atiku. 
However, he took a different turn in 2018 when he endorsed the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar.
Speaking further at the symposium, which was themed ‘Nigeria 2019: Countering Fake News', Soyinka advised that psychiatrists be involved in the advocacy against fake news. 
He reasoned that peddlers of fake news have mental problems.
He went on to share his experience on how fake news has affected him, saying he had heard of news of his own death numerous times and laughable statements which never originated from him had been circulated as his.
He continued: "During the last presidency, there was a statement attributed to me that I said that it serves President Jonathan right for marrying an illiterate woman. 
I never made any comment whatsoever about her and suddenly here it is staring me in the face.
“An account (on Facebook) has even been created in my name and from time to time a card is sent to me and it reads, ‘Wole Soyinka says anyone who votes for this person must be stupid, must be mentally retarded, his mother must be a goat and his father must be a gorilla.’
“And this comes on all the time and I don’t want to understate the numerous motivations going into this. 
Although basically, I think the commonality is that those who create fake news are sick in the head and they are also cowards because they lack the conviction for their own beliefs and so they try to attribute to other people what they are thinking.”
“I have insisted that it is something that must be treated criminally but I don’t want this to become an opportunity for our very bloodthirsty legislators to push the kind of law which they tried to enact the other time which they were decreeing capital punishment for any hate speech.
“I don’t know how far it has gone, whether they have dropped it or if it is on the president's table but nothing I say today should be taken as an endorsement of that lunacy.
“If people are bloodthirsty they should go and join Boko Haram instead of using the legislative chambers to initiate another opportunity for slaughtering people for speaking their minds like Khashoggi. 
Let us be very careful about that.”
He advised that social media platforms like Facebook should put in more efforts in curtailing fake news. 
He also called on the need for INTERPOL and other global law enforcement agencies to join hand in the war against fake news.
Soyinka also took out time to comment on the leaked audio of Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation.
“Just two or three days ago, I read an item where a minister was supposed to have insulted the president and it was carried in some media and I checked the statement and of course there was a video and so on and I looked through it, I read the text again and again and I said I have to relearn English language because I didn’t see where the insults were.
“So sometimes, print media feels compelled to compete with the electronic media and this is a great mistake because there is a reputation, there is an expectation and you should not be embarrassed to show yourself superior to a medium which is accessible to the lowest, the very dregs of society.”

As President Buhari Joins PDP By Sonala Olumhense
The truth is that with Buhari’s intended cabinet, he has clearly given up
every pretense of combating corruption or achieving anything. 
His nominations are a cynical and arrogant slap on the face of hope.
Sonala Olumhense Syndicated
In the mid-1980s, I became friends with a legendary Nigerian soldier known as “Black Scorpion.” 
His real name was Benjamin Adekunle, smallish stripe of a man who had acquired the reputation of a killer during the civil war. 
Tales abound about how he could reduce opposing military formations—and men twice his size—to dissolution and tears.
When we met, I was the editor of ThisWeek magazine, and our offices were in Surulere where he lived. 
Encouraged by his endless supplies of adult beverages, we would discuss politics and books in his home for hours.
Books? I was stunned by the man’s love for books. 
He owned two large libraries, and you could borrow any you wished. 
On one condition: you had to sign for it and return it in no later than two weeks. 
Actually the way he saw it: if you read a book, that deserved a lavish supply of those beverages, to help with a full interrogation of the ideas in it.
That was a new school to me: that a military man known for brutality would be so dedicated to enriching himself intellectually and culturally. 
Black Scorpion’s eloquence spoke volumes. 
But it was his insights that impressed me the most. 
Such wealth can arise from interaction with the world through training and travel, of course, but it is in books—the land of the minds of others—that they are most powerful. 
That is probably because the agricultural processes in the mind of the reader continue to nurture that individual through time in ways others cannot see.
This is what occurred to me last week when I first read the list of the cabinet nominees President Muhammadu Buhari sent to the Senate.
I do not know the last time Buhari read a book. Or a newspaper. Or a magazine. Or whether he has ever read a book. Or a newspaper. Or a magazine.
And given his secretive medical history, I do not know the last time Buhari heard anything. 
I don’t mean hearing simply in what people are saying on the streets, on radio or on television, but in the basic terms of human hearing: sound waves vibrating through the ear canal into the inner ear. 
As in the interpretation of sound. 
Because if Buhari can either read or hear, or both, there is a major disconnect between his physical and intellectual abilities, and his mental output. 
Just as there has been a major disconnect between his words and his actions for four years.
Take his latest cabinet nominations, for instance. 
The list contains some people that most Nigerians didn’t know; some that are well-known; and a few that are described as excellent human beings. 
But mostly—and I cite contemporary history in evidence—it consists of established thieves, election riggers, failed and/or compromised former Ministers and former Governors, state looters, federal looters, and parallel state/federal looters.
Yes, the same Buhari who swore to vanquish corruption, nominated or re-nominated them. 
The same Buhari who suggested that some of them had failed to perform in his first term only because they had been strangers to him when he appointed them, and who took five months to find new Ministers, re-nominated them.
This is why, two and a half years ago, I said “Buhari’s much-heralded leadership has become a farce, and his ability to make a positive impact on Nigeria, a hoax.”
In the weeks before he named new nominees, the same Buhari who had sworn he would scour the world for Nigeria’s very best, was telling the world he would only appoint people known to him. 
Which, for a man who has become established for nepotism, was unnecessary: if you already enjoy global infamy, why seize the microphone to broadcast history as spoiler?
Under Buhari’s nurturing, corruption has mutated from an Alsatian dog to a lion. 
Under Buhari, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has become the byword for corruption, incompetence and malice. 
It is a party where political godfathers own states and eat their people, as Bola Tinubu’s Lagos and Adams Oshiomhole’s Edo, demonstrate.
The same Oshiomhole, now the APC chairman, explained the party’s real philosophy during a rally in Benin City last January: there is no Nigeria or justice, only politics: “Yes, once you join the APC, your sins are forgiven,” he announced.
Under Buhari, petitions against people known to Buhari simply disappear, as in the case of two (former) Governors/Ministers who allegedly looted Lagos and Rivers States. 
Oshiomhole himself was dragged to court for fraud and interrogated by the police for taking massive bribes to influence party primaries.
Under Buhari, a governor can be caught on video stuffing millions of dollar bills into his agbada, as in the case of Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, and yet enjoy his confidence rather than suffer his anger or investigation. 
Or you can be a former governor, such as Danjuma Goje, who gets your long EFCC trial vacated by the president. Because there is only APC.
Under Buhari, you don’t have to be qualified, or to have a valid certificate: should you need one, you can forge one, or explain that yours was eaten by termites or rats.
Under Buhari, you don’t have to achieve anything to receive a major appointment, or to achieve anything once you are appointed.
Under Buhari, funds in your care do not have to be used to serve the people or to accomplish set objectives. 
And funds, of course, can be eaten by snakes or gorillas.
Under Buhari, no corruption case initiated by the administration has seen any convictions. 
Precedent is clear that members of Buhari’s cabinet and party under investigation or trial will either have their cases dropped, or benefit from what I call “Nollywood trials”: the kind that go on year after year after year. 
Rotimi Amaechi, a returnee-Minister, earlier this month provided a reflection.
“I know politicians who have suddenly become billionaires, and this is the money that should have been used to build roads and provide amenities that could have been used to improve the lives of citizens,” he told a group of young Nigerians.
Note that he specifically said “suddenly.” And “billionaires,” not millionaires.
And consider that there have been only seven Ministers in that portfolio in the past 20 years, some of them serving but briefly. 
Which of them do you think became billionaires, unknown to Mr. Integrity?
Note also, that Amaechi made the statement just 24 hours after Buhari promised that APC will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.
Commented the former governor: “Our politicians have to be clear about how they intend to lift people out of poverty.”
The truth is that with Buhari’s intended cabinet, he has clearly given up every pretense of combating corruption or achieving anything. 
His nominations are a cynical and arrogant slap on the face of hope.
“If we don’t kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria,” he used to say.
Well, he didn’t, or ever intended to try. And now, that the hiding is over, it is clear where the Nigeria story is going.
Now we have that out of the way, all that is left is an apology to PDP, no literacy skills needed.

Probe Of DSS Court Invasion Ordered By Nigerian Senate
The secret police had stormed the place to effect the rearrest of pro-democracy campaigner and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, who was standing trial in a case brought against him by the Nigerian Government.
The Nigerian Senate is set to investigate the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by operatives of the Department of State Services last Friday.
Evidently, Mr Bichi’s DSS has become a major threat to the norms and values of a democratic system. 
The time has come for Mr Yusuf Bichi to step down as the head of the organisation.     
We hereby demand that he should immediately step down as boss of the DSS. 
We also demand that the DSS tenders a public apology to the judiciary for its unwarranted assault on the sacred institution."
Sade Adu’s Child Completes Transition From Female To Male
Thank you for staying by my side these past six months Mumma. 
Thank you for fighting with me to complete the man I am.
Child of British-Nigerian singer, Sade Adu, Izaak, has completed the transition from female to male following the success of a phalloplasty (a plastic surgery to construct a penis).
In an emotional message on his Instagram handle on Thursday, Izaak, who is the only child of the soulful singer from her former relationship with reggae music producer, Bob Morgan, expressed gratitude to Adu for sticking by him throughout the process.
He shared a picture of himself hugging his mom upon his return home after the successful surgery.
Alongside the picture, he wrote. 
“It’s been a long, hard road but we did it. We are coming home.
“Thank you for staying by my side these past six months Mumma. 
Thank you for fighting with me to complete the man I am.
“Thank you for your encouragement when things are hard, for the love you give me. The purest heart. I love you so much.”
In 2016, Izaak came out as transgender to coincide with National Coming Out Day.
Set Your Ovaries Free', President Tells Women
He said a higher birth rate would achieve faster progress.
John Magufuli, Tanzania's President has called on women to "set your ovaries free" and bear more children so that the country can enjoy demographic dividends.
Magufuli, who cited Nigeria and China as examples, said, "When you have a big population you build the economy. 
That's why China's economy is so huge.
I know that those who like to block ovaries will complain about my remarks. Set your ovaries free, let them block theirs.
Aljazeera reports that since taking office in 2015, Magufuli has launched an industrialization campaign that has helped buoy economic growth, which has averaged six to seven percent annually in recent years.
He said a higher birth rate would achieve faster progress.
Shoprite Will Suffer From Xenophobic Attacks, Says Analyst
The multinational has seen its shops attacked in Nigeria and also fell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, along with telecoms firm, MTN.
An analyst at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town, South Africa, Nolwandle Mthombeni, has said that consumer retail chain, Shoprite, will be hard hit by recent reprisal attacks on South African businesses across several countries on the continent.
The multinational has seen its shops attacked in Nigeria and also fell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, along with telecoms firm, MTN.
He told Bloomberg South Africa that, “From footage I’ve seen, it most definitely will hit Shoprite hard because it goes beyond lost sales, but also cost of repairs and restoring the damage.”
Leaders of Congo DR, Rwanda, Zambia, Nigeria and a few others boycotted the World Economic Forum summit holding in South Africa.
The Nigerian Government has also asked the South African Government to pay compensation for damages done to Nigerian businesses in the country.
Over 50 shops owned by nationals of other African countries including Nigerians were broken into and looted by South Africans in a spate of attacks that started on Sunday.
Several Nigerians had been murdered before those attacks started.
A Sick Nation And Her Sickening Secret Service By Erasmus Ikhide
How best do we describe a beastly secret service or its operatives whose beastiality threatens national cohesion, the nation's constitution and the judiciary, democracy and its majestic ethos?
The citizens' clarion call that the Department of State Services should be scrapped forthwith by the act of National Assembly and its operatives from top to bottom debriefed; re-educated, even rusticated or redistributed to other minimally functional paramilitary institutions like the Nigeria Police Force will no doubt heals the nation of the wounds from the vested madness and brutality the secret service has visited on the failed state called Nigeria.
How best do we describe a beastly secret service or its operatives whose beastiality threatens national cohesion, the nation's constitution and the judiciary, democracy and its majestic ethos?. 
Who need an obsolete self-serving stone age anti-democratic security outfit, with scant methodology on intelligence gathering, lacking in cybernetics sophistry without a single idea on how to tame real and actual security threats to the nation?
The DSS needs internal purgation, and urgently too. 
Someone like Peter Afunanya, its spokesperson, should be thrown out of the window for further disgracing an ethically flawed institution which knew next to nothing about intelligence gathering, solely masquerading as an attack dog for the presidency.
The conundrum has been why furnish and burnish criminal government with false intelligence reports against the citizens when the real enemy of the state is the same vampire government?. 
I have laboured in the past to educate the DSS and her collaborators that its protective alibi labelled "national security" is a mere subterfuge. 
The actual name is "regime security" coded as "national security" to defraud and cow uninformed citizens to submission. 
Citizens must not be given order by lawless secret service that can not differentiate between Boko Haram and social change agents and activists.
Tragically, Peter Afunanya is a poor image maker for the DSS with his amateurish defence and blatant falsehood he puts forward on the several viral videos that signposted the desecration of the hall of justice at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday by the DSS.
Afunanya couldn't hide the fact that doing the bidding of a murderous tyrant is different from protective media anchorage. 
He could still not give valid reasons or answers as to why the DSS rearrested Omoyele Sowore after less than 24 hours after he was released on bail.
Like the ostrich that he is, Afunanya buried his head and that of the DSS in the sand without a word on the abduction of the journalist and human rights activist in a bizarre and gangly despotic manner. 
Afunanya spilled poor half-truth on the secret service disgraceful outing without mentioning the commando-like but shameful exhibition of empty power in the midst of defenceless citizens.
What's the usefulness of a discredited ethnically cultivated and motivated compromised secret service that could not decipher or detect activities of murderous militias like Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen long before they unleash terror on the nation? 
What's the DSS's day job when cultists kill themselves and cause mayhem on a daily basis across the country? 
What inform DSS open contempt for the judiciary and the law, if not misplaced intelligence computation, analysis and misplaced priority?
It's time the National Assembly revisits the law that established the DSS for taking sadistic pleasure in dehumanising Nigerians. 
The DSS needs complete restructuring or outright scrapping from its present banality and rescue it away from being an appendage of any president in power or unlisted powerful individuals at the corridors of power.
Without that, Nigerians would wake up one day and be told that the notorious scofflaw has created her own law courts where they (the DSS) can now do maximum violence to Nigerian citizens, democracy and civilisation.

Simi Vs Victor Uwaifo: The True Story Of 'Joromi'
Simi is being sued for N50 million damages for using the word 'Joromi' in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.
Joromi' was the same song title Uwaifo gave to his 1979 global hit.
In recent times, Nigerian singer Simi has had her name mentioned several times by Nigerian legendary guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, over what he claimed to be a copyright infringement of his song, 'Joromi'.
Simi is being sued for N50 million damages for using the word 'Joromi' in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.
'Joromi' was the same song title Uwaifo gave to his 1979 global hit.
The case between both artistes is generating debates on what constitutes copyright infringement.
Amidst this, SaharaReporters visited the historical 'Revelation Tourist Palazzo' built and developed by Uwaifo where it was revealed that the name 'Joromi' was not just the title of a song but the name of a famous fighter from Benin.
Giving a tour of the centre, the curator, Chris Eburu, said prior to the death of Joromi’s father, he warned Joromi not to climb the palm tree located at the backyard of the house.
However, Joromi defied this order and met his death in the hands of a masquerade in hellfire.
Eburu said: "Joromi was a famous wrestler in Benin. 
He dislodged everyone who dared him. 
He was the champion. When his father was about to die, the only thing he bequeathed to his son was a warning.
“He warned him never to climb the palm tree at the backyard but when the father died, on one Sunday afternoon as Joromi was taking a stroll around his father’s backyard he spotted this particular palm tree and looked at it pensively and began to wonder why his father told him not to climb the palm tree.
“The daring Joromi climbed on top of it while his sister turned into a fly and accompanied him. 
When they eventually got to the zenith of that tree, they grew out of the natural state and they landed in a place called 'hell' where Joromi noticed with dismay that the least person in hell had two heads but Joromi wanted to fight, the battle line was drawn.
"Continuing the myth, the curator said, “From one to the other, he conquered all of them from the one that had two heads then to the ones that had six heads he destroyed all of them plucking off their extra heads and telling them categorically that they were better off having one head."
'Who asked you to have more than one (head)? On earth, we have one head. 
Who asked you to have more than one head?' Joromi queried but when the seven-headed spirit, Ugbogweli appeared - in fact, he was breathing and smoking fire all over him - that was when Joromi sister began to sing.
"Joromi once more turned deaf ears and for the first time as he ran down to the battle line, he witnessed a bitter piece of death for the very first time. 
Life was off him and the man called Joromi died.
"However, Eburu said, "Luckily for him, the sister spotted a leaf that had life in it. 
She plucked it, squeezed it and subsequently applied the juice on the five senses of the brother who now regained consciousness.
"This time when he stood up he was no longer ready to fight and he began to race back to earth but Ugbogweli would never let him go. 
When he got to the bridge between hellfire and earth and was about to cross to the latter, Ugbogweli stretched his hand to grab Joromi but luckily for Joromi Ugbogweli could run his fingers down the back of Joromi.
"The curator then made a curious statement: "Those of us in this part of the world hold the belief that the encounter that Joromi had with Ugbogweli is the cause of the spines humans have."
Sowore: Court Invasion, Manifestation Of Failed Democracy -ADC Chair
We have seen these signs creeping into the system for many years, not even a few months ago and it’s giving us serious concern. 
It has come out in full blast.
Omoyele Sowore
BBC
National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress, Ralph Nwosu, has condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy activist and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, describing it as a manifestation of failed democracy.
The Department of State Services rearrested Sowore in the courtroom of Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, barely 24 hours after he was released from detention.
The action has attracted criticisms from both local and international organisations but the Nigerian Government said it was not bothered.
In an interview with PUNCH, Nwosu said, “What happened in court was a clear manifestation of a completely failed democracy. 
It is also a clear case of fascism and it is even fascism of a questionable leadership.
“We have seen these signs creeping into the system for many years, not even a few months ago and it’s giving us serious concern. 
It has come out in full blast.
“When autocratic governments start, there will be different kinds of pretentiousness, but by the time they lay out their full fangs, there is trouble.
So, people must stand for the country, and we commend a major organisation like PUNCH for standing for the country.     
“All of them should be sanctioned, so long as you are serving under this government because it is supposed to be a democracy.     
“The moment it is no longer a democracy, it’s either you are part of the autocratic and disruptive element or you are not part of it. 
And if you are not part of it, you would have to quit.     
“So, anybody who was in doubt before and continues to be part of the government after what happened in the court should be sanctioned.”     
Sowore: DSS' Incompetence And The Docility Of The National Assembly By Martin White-Ufuah.     
We are presently under the attack of cyber espionages, but because the DSS do not have the structural competence to checkmate the economic security threat of foreign espionages in our country's internet space, they do not know the danger their activities portend for our country.     
With DSS' bold outlaw, subnormal intelligence, defective disposition, and outright violation of different court orders, it has become indisputably clear that Nigeria's democracy has been militarised.     
The 9th rubber-stamp National Assembly that is supposed to restrain the overreaching extents of the executive has openly obliged to doing the bidding of the executive.     
Obviously, the legislative arm of government in Nigeria has transformed itself into a branch of the executive.    
Today, the only distinguishing characteristic of our bogus democracy from the military dictatorship is that we waste tax payers’ money to service an institution (National Assembly) that is tractable to executive rascality.     
Our democracy is a charade!     
If it isn't, the illegal detention of Omoyele Sowore and other Nigerians by the DSS should have been a topical discourse in the National Assembly to check the excesses of the executive.     
Nigeria is currently perplexed, bedevilled and overwhelmed by the lethality of human right abuses that ridicules and exposes our own brand of democracy as a fraud.     
Instead of a vibrantly energetic and engaging legislature that imposes a legislative sanction on the DSS' boss and the country's attorney-general over the illegal detention of Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, they are vigorously pursuing bills on hate speech and social media regulation.     
The National Assembly is sleeping on duty!     
The DSS should be publicly condemned for its chronic law-breaking antecedence.     
By the unlawful gestapo arrest, clandestine and illegal detention and persecution of Omoyele Sowore, the Department of State Service, has shown that it is markedly subnormal in function, flawed in intelligence and rascal in behaviour.     
The criminal-classed elements sponsored by state actors that took up arms against the Nigerian state during the Kogi and Bayelsa elections were never seen to have committed treasonable felony.     
But Omoyele Sowore who only sued for peace by calling on Nigerians to pour out in their numbers to protest against misrule and corruption is being accused of plotting to unseat the government.     
What a joke of a country!     
Obviously, the DSS is merely a political stooge that react against voices of truth that attempt to call the government to order.     
Instead of a vibrantly energetic and engaging domestic intelligence agency that functions as the source of reliable information for mitigating our various internal security challenges, our moribund DSS is all about the pettiness of political arrests and illegal detentions of honourable citizens.     
The calculated use of violence against our country by Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram members and other criminal groups with felonious intent have never for once been comprehended by the radar coverage of our so-called DSS domestic intelligence.     
Isn't that a big shame?     
The DSS has shown that it does not have the structural competence and expertise for espionages and information gathering. 
That is why the agency relies on online gossips and maliciously divulged information to clamp on citizens.     
Domestic intelligence service is also supposed to be responsible for identifying foreign spies employed by foreign services against a country.     
Every day we hear of other countries exposing and apprehending foreign spies and agents employed by foreign intelligence services against their government.     
Please, how many has the DSS caught? None! Why? 
They think their job is to go after Omoyele Sowore.     
If the DSS understand the danger foreign espionages poses to our country, they'd resign from their pettiness and become serious for once.     
Some foreign espionages have access to our country's internet space without anyone knowing their identity.     
They are sometimes the ones spreading propagandas and disinformation on our local internet space to cause dissension and unrest.     
We are presently under the attack of cyber espionages, but because the DSS do not have the structural competence to checkmate the economic security threat of foreign espionages in our country's internet space, they do not know the danger their activities portend for our country.     
I'm writing this to tell the DSS to release Omoyele Sowore right now with an apology to him because he is not a terrorist.

Sowore: Government Has Ordered Investigation Into Invasion Of Court By DSS -Malami.     
Sowore was arrested in the court by the DSS less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after a third order by the court.     
Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has revealed that the Nigerian Government has ordered an investigation into the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by operatives of the Department of State Services to rearrest Omoyele Sowore.     
Sowore was arrested in the court by the DSS less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after a third order by the court.     
Malami was questioned by reporters when he was seen at the premises of the Federal High Court, Abuja.     
When asked why he was in court, Malami said he did not come because of Sowore but to congratulate the judge on being confirmed as the substantive Chief Judge of the court.     
He however, revealed that the government had instituted a panel to investigate the invasion of the court.     
Asked if he was not appalled by the DSS’ conduct, Malami said, “Whatever affects the integrity of the court is a worrisome issue for us.     
“I can never be preemptive of an incident over which I was not a live witness to.     
“But one thing I am certain of is that the government has put in place mechanism for investigation of the reported incident.     
“So, I would not like to be preemptive in terms of a conclusion, one way or the other, without allowing the consummation and conclusion of the investigation process.”     
Sowore: Nigeria Has A Way Of Punishing The Innocent, Says Banky W     “Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and trampling on the rights, dreams and hopes of the regular citizens.
Nigerian musician, Bankole Wellington popularly known as Banky W, has reacted to the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday ordering the Department of State Services to immediately release pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, on bail.
In a statement on Tuesday, Banky-W described Nigeria as a county that prides itself in punishing the innocent.
He said, “I'm so thankful that our justice system made the right call by granting the release of Omoyele Sowore.
“Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and trampling on the rights, dreams and hopes of the regular citizens.
“Every time our leaders do wrong and get away with it, we lose a little piece of our soul.
“We become numb, we lose hope, and we subconsciously accept that this is how things are and there's nothing we can say or do to change it.
“You didn't need to be a voter or volunteer for Mr Sowore to see that this was clearly an infringement on a basic human right and a grave injustice.
“Freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest is the unassailable right of every Nigerian citizen.
“May God bless those in our justice system who stood on the right side of history by doing the right thing.
“May God strengthen, comfort and bless Sowore, his wife and family as they have endured the most difficult of times while only being guilty of attempting to speak up for a better Nigeria.”
Sowore Is Our Benefactor, Not A Criminal –Ondo Students
Irinyemi stated that the Sowore Scholarship Foundation, which had helped many parents in the state to send their children to school, has been stopped since he was arrested and detained by the DSS.
A group of students in Ondo State have taken to the streets to protest the continued detention of the pro-democracy activist and Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, by the Department of State Services.
The students, under the platform of the National Association of Kiribo Students, said that the continued detention of Sowore should be rejected by all lovers of Nigeria.
The protesters marched all the way to Idepe Town under Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state, chanting songs of solidarity and calling for the immediate release of Sowore, who had made scholarship offers available to them over the years.
According to the students, the recent declaration of Sowore and Olawale Bakare as "prisoners of conscience" by Amnesty International, has showed that the pro-democracy activist was being recognised globally as one of the few Africans that have demonstrated doggedness.
Spokesperson for the protesting students, Samuel Irinyemi, told SaharaReporters that many of them benefiting from Sowore's scholarship programme had continued to feel his continued detention.
He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to obey court orders by mandating the security agency to release Sowore to his family.
Irinyemi, “We are just a few of the many students benefiting directly from Omoyele Sowore's scholarship foundation in Ondo State.
We are sad that our brother and great benefactor was arrested and had since been detained by the DSS over frivolous charges. 
Sowore is not a criminal because we know his history very well.    
“This is a man that placed many of us on scholarship with his personal money and made it possible for us to have education.     
“I have been benefiting from his kind gesture for close to five years now.     
So, we are not happy about his continued detention despite court orders granting his release.
We are pleading with President Buhari to release Sowore from the detention of the DSS.     
“Sowore that we know is a freedom fighter and he means well for Nigeria as a country.”     
Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Buhari.     
The government is accusing him of insulting Buhari and planning to topple his regime through the planned protests.     
Despite two orders by the Federal High Court, Abuja, directing the DSS to release him on bail since that period, the activist has remained in government detention, attracting condemnation from around the world.     
Sowore: Sultan Of Sokoto Tells Buhari To Obey Court Orders     
Abubakar said nobody can decide to disregard the court at will, adding that it would be detrimental to national development.     
The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, has told President Muhammadu Buhari and all those in his regime to obey court orders because according to him failure to do so holds dire consequences.     
The Sultan gave the warning while speaking at the 2019 fourth quarter meeting of the Nigeria Inter-religious Council in Abuja.     
Abubakar said nobody can decide to disregard the court at will, adding that it would be detrimental to national development.     
He said, “We must regularly obey and respect the laws of our land.     
We should never disregard the laws to avoid the consequences.
If a court makes a judicial pronouncement on a particular matter, it should be obeyed to the letter.     
“If you have any problem or disagree with the pronouncement, the next step is to appeal the pronouncement instead of disregarding or violating court judgments.     
If you are served a court order and you deliberately refused to obey it because you are a governor, president or any influential person, then you are setting a dangerous precedent."
The Nigerian Government has failed to release Omoyele Sowore, disregarding two court orders by two different judges.
Sowore was rearrested at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday by operatives of the Department of State Services less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after 125 days in detention.
The invasion of the court and refusal to obey court orders has by President Buhari’s regime has been condemned from around the world.
The government is accusing him of insulting President Muhammadu Buhari and planning to bring down his regime.
Soyinka: 'Sowore, Welcome To The Club' As Nobel Laureate Slams Buhari Regime As Being Paranoid
The Buhari regime had on Friday filed seven counts of treasonable
felony and money laundering against Sowore.
Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, says the President MuhammaduBuhari regime has attained an “unprecedented level of paranoia”following the charges of treason filed against human rights activist,Omoyele Sowore.
In a statement on Saturday, Soyinka said the nation had failed tolearn from past experiences.
He said, “This is utterly depressing news. 
So, the Sowore affair hasmoved beyond harassment and taken on a sinister direction. 
Outside thecountry where I happened to be engaged at the moment, I can testifythat the immediate reaction around me was to dismiss this as yetanother grotesque product of fake news, of which Nigerians have becomethe greatest practitioners. 
I confess that I also joined in thisschool of thought – at the start.
“Further checks have however confirmed that this government has indeedattained an unprecedented level of paranoia. 
I do not believe that thejustice department itself believes in these improbable charges, asformally publicized.
"So, once again, we inscribe in our annals another season oftreasonable felony. 
History still guards some lessons we have yet todigest, much less from which to learn. 
Welcome to the Club, Mr.Omoyele Sowore.”
The Buhari regime had on Friday filed seven counts of treasonablefelony and money laundering against Sowore.
The charges were filed a day before the expiration of the detentionorder of the Federal High Court in Abuja permitting the Department ofState Services to keep the activist for 45 days.
SPECIAL REPORT: Why Troops Are Losing Ground To ISWAP
Is the 2018 military strategy and campaign working? 
The facts based on the number of military formations successfully attacked and overran by ISWAP in 2018 in the areas of its dominance is 70 percent. 
What this translates into is that out of 20 military bases in these territories, ISWAP have either sacked by overrunning or forced the military to shut down a total of 14 bases in 2018 alone. 
The only time this ratio of attacks and takeovers came close to the 2018 numbers was in 2014. 
By the end of 2015 it was below 50% success ratio, which further dropped in 2016 and 2017, only to witness a sharp surge in 2018.
In the few days leading to the eclipse on 2018, reports from the warfront in North East Nigeria provoked huge concerns, fiercely stirring panic within communities in and around Maiduguri, Borno state. 
Governor Kashim Shettima, within this period, quickly called an emergency security meeting to receive briefs from different security commands in the state. 
At the Executive chambers of the Government House, Maiduguri, the seat of power in the state, the situation was grim and faces drawn.
In fact, the situation appeared so dire as Nigerian troops facing the onslaught of the combined affront of insurgency from terror groups, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram forces, beat a steady retreat, incurring monumental losses of locational facilities. 
Within two weeks, the Nigerian troops had retreated tactically or been overrun in strategic military bases. 
Out of 20 military bases in northern and central Borno where Nigerian troops were in control, 14 had been overrun or altogether shut down.
Does the recent string of losses by the military represent a momentary setback likely to be overturned swiftly by the military or is the trend a fore-test of an uncertain future? 
All diplomatic and international military platforms knowledgeable about the escalating conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin affirm that at no time since the surge of violence in the region have the terrorists been in command of the level of weapons available to them today. 
Two developments explain this.
The terror groups, in recent times, have received a flush of funds from ransom paid to them allegedly by the government. 
Equally, there has been a steady access to unimaginable cache of military weaponry, including hardware and ammunition from bases overran by the insurgents, remarkably bolstering their war chest. 
For instance, the loss of the International Military Task Force Base, headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, headed by an Army General, is reported as monumental, not merely in the loss, of location but because of the massive military hardware and ammunition only comparable to what is available to the Military Division in Maiduguri, to ISWAP.
The insurgents are obviously riding the momentum and are motivated in manners that are completely alien to the military. 
According to a recent report by the AFP, in no year since the upsurge of conflicts in the North East have Nigerian troops been exposed to the level of casualties inflicted on them by the insurgents in 2018 alone. 
With an enlarged war chest, a strategic control of the economic mainstay of the Chad Basin cross cutting fishing, all season farming, water and control of cross border trade routes, the insurgents are looking formidable.
No wonder, they have recently scaled up recruitment of new fighters across both English and French speaking countries in the surrounding countries of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Information gleaned from contacts within the fold of ISWAP paint an insight that seems to have challenged the position of politicians and the military in respect of holding territory. 
ISWAP always considered the territories of Northern and Central Borno their Caliphate territories. 
The presence of the Nigerian troops and particularly military bases were considered invasion by the military.
Bidding their time until they had adequate ammunition with additional army of motivated fighters to unleash new wave of violence the group was willing to stay under the radar for a few years before drawing the line on the sand. Their long wait paid off in 2018. They have been on the offensive all of 2018. The ISWAP’s strategy is to put everything available to ensure that military presence in those territories they consider part of their caliphate is made ever untenable. ISWAP considers all parts of north and central Borno as its caliphate and territory and therefore obligated by doctrines and commandment to repel every external aggression within the territory.
This is irrespective of whatever politicians and the military claim is the situation within those territories. 
In fact, Boko Haram / ISWAP policy with respect to physically holding territories changed after the steady losses they suffered in the run up to general elections in Nigeria in 2014. 
They do not want to physically hold unto territories anymore than they are determined to ensure that the military does not have any sustainable presence in the territories. 
Furthermore, ISWAP is paying more premium to wooing local communities to feel more secure with them than they could ever be with the military. 
That is their strategy.
They have secured the economic lines in the territories they control. 
The Lake Chad territories have become more fertile for famers and more viable for commercial fishing activities. 
They have largely crippled the fish and onions markets in Maiduguri. 
In its stead, they have opened secured trading locations in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic and another in Kusiri, in Cameroon. 
Nigerian traders rely on the market in Kusiri, Cameroon through Mubi, in Adamawa. 
The other in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic. 
The Nigerian market in Hadeja, Jigawa state depend heavily on the market in Niger Republic.
Nigerian troops apparently would rather confiscate a trader’s wares, forcibly take their livestock for their feeding than device any system of commercial comfort that would help them grow their business. 
It therefore seems not far-fetched that several local communities appear to cooperate better with ISWAP than with the Nigerian troops. 
ISWAP want to primarily make it unattractive and too expensive in terms of body count and loss of hardware for the military to maintain a base in any of these territories. 
They calculate that as long as they continually target and attack military formations, forcing them to beat a retreat so long would it be easier for local communities to accept that they are more secure in the territories under them than under the cover of Nigerian troops.
Moreover, they envisage that for as long as they sustain the push back against the military for so long will it be difficult for the demoralized troops to muster confidence to put them at tactical disadvantage anytime soon. 
Is the 2018 military strategy and campaign working? The facts based on the number of military formations successfully attacked and overran by ISWAP in 2018 in the areas of its dominance is 70 percent. 
What this translates into is that out of 20 military bases in these territories, ISWAP have either sacked by overrunning or forced the military to shut down a total of 14 bases in 2018 alone. 
The only time this ratio of attacks and takeovers came close to the 2018 numbers was in 2014. 
By the end of 2015 it was below 50% success ratio, which further dropped in 2016 and 2017, only to witness a sharp surge in 2018.
The outlook of the map in the battle theatres is grim. 
The territories that constitute Northern Borno are 10 Local Government Areas lying north of Maiduguri and bearing natural land borders with three countries namely Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon. 
ISWAP have full sway in these territories currently. 
The territories that constitute Borno Central are made up of eight Local Government Areas, and both ISWAP and Boko Haram have significant footholds in these territories. 
Southern Borno, made up of nine Local Government Areas, is the least affected, with the exception of flashpoints such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok. 
With barely 45 days to presidential election in Nigeria there seems to be more energy at official quarters to cover up the tragic situation than acknowledging it.
The military have rightly stated that ISWAP may not be holding most of the territories where it overran its bases, especially the town of Baga. 
ISWAP, on its part, is also right when it says it has sacked soldiers from the areas it attacked, including Baga. Neither the military nor the insurgents have the manpower and capacity to hold and govern over these large expanse of land sustainably. 
But in desisting from building visible administrative and military structures in the areas of their primary interest ISWAP have evolved in a way that is difficult for Nigerian troops to track. 
On the other hand, by being fixated with claim of control of territories the military have only succeeded in making its troops sitting ducks and easy targets of the enemy.
More clearly, ISWAP is no longer showing interest in taking a formidable military base such as was in Baga and staying put there. 
It doesn’t apparently serve their tactical and strategic interest well. 
They are more interested in taking over military hardware and ammunition in those bases while instilling fear on the troops and making it extremely difficult for the military to have the comfort to plan and launch attacks. 
For instance, two days after overrunning the military base in Baga, the ISWAP moved out of location with military hardware and ammunition. 
According to knowledgeable sources, the objective is not to necessarily capture and hold new territories, what is far more strategic to ISWAP is to continually “unsettle the military in their bases across the Lake Chad region.”
There is no better indication to the effectiveness of the tactical approach of ISWAP against the military than seeing that Nigerian troops in the troubled locations are unable to undertake patrol duties. 
Rather, they are mostly in the trenches practically waiting for the next attack. 
One troubling outcome of this is the escalating number of troops on desertion charge. 
For instance, in just one detention centre in Jos, Plateau state, there are over 20 military deserters rounded up and detained. 
Similarly, a growing army of deserters are being held across major military detention facilities in the country. 
Obviously embarrassed at this turn of events, the military authorities are zealously covering up on these.
An Army officer currently hospitalized lamented that “soldiers have become cannon fodders,” revealing:"There are more soldiers deserting their commission over Boko Haram war. 
I can count dozens in my unit alone that escaped after they survived an attack.” 
The Nigerian Police Force are embroiled in similar matter with 121 officers of the rank-and-file who reportedly deserted in protest against planned deployment to the warfront dismissed with immediate effect.
The Inspector-General Ibrahim Idris, according to a report in Premium Times (December 28, 2018), ordered their dismissal. 
“The Police are very kind to their officers for dismissing them, we are not that lucky because after we attempted to escape, we were arrested and detained without trial for several months,” said a soldier detained in one of Special Task Force (STF) detention centers in Jos. 
He was arrested after he absconded along with scores of his colleagues from the warfront.
A confident Army Captain in the frontlines who spoke with our reporter on condition of anonymity extolled the troops for their gallantry on several occasions. 
He said that unlike the terrorists, the military do not carry cameras into the battlefront to record gun exchanges. 
According to him there are far more attacks on military bases and units by the terrorists that were repelled than the ones in which the locations were overrun. 
“The terrorists go to battles with cameras, while we, as a matter of policy don’t.” 
Nevertheless, he contends that Nigerians do not care about the number of insurgents that we have killed, “the killing of soldiers that protect the country’s sovereignty constitute a source of concern, what this means is, if soldiers continue to die, Nigeria itself may fail to exist,” he concludes.
Some of these attacks were so overwhelming that the bases were overrun with hundreds of casualties. 
According to multiple media reports, not less than 1,000 soldiers were killed in 2018. 
These casualty figures do not include soldiers killed in Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and in Southern Borno. 
“In fact, there has never been a year soldiers were killed more than in 2018; not even 2013 and 2014 did we see the kind of casualties we experienced today,” said another soldier who doubles as a medical doctor in Maiduguri. 
More traumatizing for soldiers, according to ISWAP sources, are the humiliating experience of scores of abducted soldiers compelled to tutor the insurgents on new weapons handling before they are enslaved or executed.
Informed sources state that the military facility in Monguno is probably the only larest operational base outside of Maiduguri presently that is unaffected. 
Four or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, while Damasak is manned by the Multi-National Joint Task Force at the border with Niger republic. 
According to a serving military officer currently hospitalized, “the soldiers in most of these bases have all taken up defensive positions to protect their turfs and can hardly venture outside to patrol or engage in any offensive attack”.
Just like the officers deserting, the Military itself has long abandoned any mentality of “no retreat, no surrender,’ having steadily been on the retreat from several military bases. 
Weeks ago, they shut down two bases in Gudumbali and Kukawa. 
“We retreated to Monguno before Baga was attacked. 
Now, some soldiers and residents are running away from Monguno to Maiduguri,” reported a soldier in Shagari Low Cost Housing Estate in Maiduguri. 
He highlights the utter helplessness of the soldiers: what is disturbing is the effrontery of “ISWAP in making sure that we are fully made aware of their plans ahead of any attack. 
There was never an attack that we don’t see in advance, yet we are helpless,” he lamented.
In the midst of these setbacks, military fat cats are feeding exceedingly well on account of the war. 
On 28, December, 2018 the Defence and Foreign Affairs of the International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) based in the United States stated that “the conduct of the war in the North (East of Nigeria) is tied to the corruption in the military, and (President) Buhari - ring-fenced by his own team - is unable to tackle the issue". 
ISSA, the Washington-based non-governmental organization with a worldwide membership of professionals involved in national and international security and strategy, stated that massive corruption among top military chiefs appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari is the reason Nigeria is losing the war against Boko Haram.
According to the report, the only significant engagement which the Nigerian military leadership seems determined to fight “is to stop the leakage of information about massive corruption, running into the equivalent of several billions of dollars, in the purchase by senior military officers of major military capital goods and military consumables, including the troops’ own food.” 
More than anything, it is the noticeable resurgence of the Lake Chad and the commercial viability of the territories under ISWAP that present the greatest pull on individuals in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps to return to their villages. 
But for others, it is their ability to put out a good fight and sometimes win with an Army that enjoys global support, that is the biggest inspiration that makes many want to join. 
A recent recruit and a Francophone citizen said, “ISWAP's fortunes only means one thing, Allah with us.” 
Another who abandoned his rich family business in Kano to become a fighter said, “I have no doubt Angels are fighting with us, otherwise there is nothing that explains our victories.”
In the light of these realities, should the Nigerian Military continue with the tactical mentality that is leading them into embarrassing losses? 
For a government that has made so much premium of a claim on its control of territory from the insurgents, what these developments point to is probably worse than a setback. 
Efforts by independent observers to point out the evidently skewed tactical mentality have been visited with official hostility. 
Local and international Civil Society Organizations and the media have, for these reasons, come under attack by the military. 
For calling the Military out on its ignoble human rights abuses, including rape and extra judicial executions, Amnesty International and other Human Rights organizations have been targeted for official harassment.
Despite a consistent stream of global ratings and reports about Nigeria’s crisis, notable among them being the 2018 Global Terrorism Index in which Nigeria emerged the third most terrorized nation globally, both the Military and politicians in government have carried on as if this was of no consequence. 
The index placed Nigeria behind war-torn countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and ahead of Syria and Pakistan. 
However, the report also showed a 16% drop in the number of deaths linked to terrorism in 2017 from previous year.
Also, the World Economic Forum, in its biennial tourism report with the specific section focusing on safety and security, recently ranked Nigeria as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 
Amid all these disturbing realities the local media generally have caved in to a new sense of self censorship promoted by the Nigerian military, which is, “stop reporting the killings to dissuade Boko Haram from further killings” instead of, prevent the insurgents from killings in the first place, so that, there wouldn’t be any death to report.
Speeding Driver Kills Pupils In Ekiti

SSS Is Indeed A Lying Machine By Stanley Imhanruor
Since the barbaric and misguided act by the SSS was well captured on tape, it is pertinent to reference some of the pictures and videos circulating in the media space.
I have read with amusement, the press release by the SSS wherein the service unashamedly denied any attempt to rearrest Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare in the well of the court.
Since the barbaric and misguided act by the SSS was well captured on tape, it is pertinent to reference some of the pictures and videos circulating in the media space.
In the viral video, the person holding Sowore down (the man that eventually emerged beneath Sowore, wearing white shirt and a black jacket is an officer of the SSS.
Everyone could see from the viral video that when the arresting officer got up people where asking him: who are you? Who are you? But the officer refused to respond to the posers.
The officer is also arrowed in some of the viral pictures circulating on social media platforms.
The said officer is constantly around Sowore in the courtroom and he is the officer obviously detailed by the SSS to always be with Sowore in the courtroom to monitor his movement and conduct whenever the matter comes up in court whilst other officers stay some metres away watching.
For clarity, the officer's name in question is Dekko Nelly (Marshal).
Please do not be deceived by the press release by the SSS as same is merely a smokescreen designed to save its already badly battered image locally and internationally in the circumstance.
No matter how far and fast a lie travels, truth which is eternal and immutable will always overtake it in the long run.
Stop Attacking Shoprite In Nigeria, They're Owned By Nigerians -Expert Warns
He added that MTN is a publicly-listed company, hence, Nigerians are part of the shareholders and will bear part of the loss of vandalizing the firm's properties.
Rotimi Sankore, a veteran journalist, policy and development expert, has cautioned against the looting of Shoprite, a departmental store, that has been subjected to reprisal attacks following the recent Xenophobic attack in South Africa.
Sankore, who spoke during a journalism MasterClass held by the Civic Media Lab, said the stores being looted are mostly franchises owned by Nigerians.
Shoprite and Spar are mostly franchises. 
Most of the goods on the shelves are owned by Nigerians. The staff are Nigerians, he said.
He stated MTN, that has also become the target for the reprisal attacks, is a public listed company hence, Nigerians are part of the shareholders and who bear the part of the loss of vandalising its properties.
He said the Xenophobic attacks are triggered by high unemployment and high crime rates, and not because all South African hated Nigerians.
The veteran journalist also stated how the Nigerian Government could have better handled the Xenophobic attacks against its citizens.
In incidents like this when Nigerians are attacked, what you do is to summon their ambassador and demand that the perpetrators be brought to justice and that the victims be compensated. 
Also demand than police be deployed to protect Nigerians’ shops and businesses from further attacks. 
This would demonstrate to the looters that their actions are not acceptable.     
If they then fail to act, you send the ambassador home and if the attacks continue, you can then take further measures like, seizing assets of the offending countries to compensate victims.”
Sankore said it was the failure of the Nigerian Government to take strategic steps to protect Nigerians that have led to Nigerian citizens resulting to self help and some people taking advantage of the protest to loot shops.
Sudan's Ex-President, Al-Bashir, Sentenced To Two Years For Corruption
The judge handling the case told the court that under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms, the BBC reports.
Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's ex-President, has been sentenced to two years in a social reform facility for corruption.
The judge handling the case told the court that under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms, the BBC reports.
Bashir also faces charges related to the 1989 coup that brought him to power, genocide, and the killing of protesters before his ousting in April.
During the sentencing, his supporters started chanting that the trial was "political" and were ordered to leave.
They continued their protest outside the court, chanting, "There is no god but God."
It is unclear whether Bashir will be tried over widespread human rights abuses during his time in power, including allegations of war crimes in Darfur.

Talent Vs Hard Work — Lessons From Olamilekan, The 11-Year-Old Who is Macron’s Newfound Friend By Mide Ayeni
You see, Olamilekan has a mother who is futuristic. 
She understands the dynamics of success. 
Although poor, she is not blind. Olamilekan said: “When I was six, I started drawing. 
My mother noticed it and took me to an artist to learn under him.” 
First, she understands the place of talent, nurturing, mentoring and hard work. 
She saw a son who loved to draw decided to NURTURE the TALENT by enrolling him with an artist, who will MENTOR and TRAIN him so that his TALENT can boom.
I will tell you a story about talent and hard work. Which should come first?
It's going to be a long read.
First thing, I will also like to re-echo my constant words that “in 20 years’ time, ‘rock bottom’ will produce famous people more than ‘privilege.’”
This afternoon, I had a chat with hubby about Olamilekan, that is the young 11-year-old who met with the President of France and drew his portrait in less than two hours.
Well, let me explain. 
At the Afrika Shrine, where the French President went yesterday, the boy went to work and came out with a perfect portrait of Macron. 
The President was so thrilled that he said “This is exceptional”.
Let's talk about Olamilekan.
He's from a poor background. 
Rock bottom background! To most of us who see ourselves as average, Olamilekan sees us as privileged. 
He's so poor that he said: “In his family, they have to toil and sweat before they can put food on the table.” 
So he made a portrait showing a young boy with sweat all over him putting food on his table.
Olamilekan was so emotional when he was speaking to BBC about that art work that I could sense the tears in his words. 
He called it his favourite.
He is barely 11 years and he understands poverty and struggle so much that he could make a picture of it. 
Then you need to understand where he's coming from.
Secondly, if you saw the house where Olamilekan was interviewed, you will understand his roots — his life and his story.
I was drawn to him when I first saw the interview and downloaded the video to share with my son. 
You will also agree that I have posted his videos here more than twice. I was touched.
Let me tell you a secret that many people don't know.
You see, Olamilekan has a mother who is futuristic. 
She understands the dynamics of success. 
Although poor, she is not blind. 
Olamilekan said: “When I was six, I started drawing. 
My mother noticed it and took me to an artist to learn under him.”
First, she understands the place of talent, nurturing, mentoring and hard work. 
She saw a son who loved to draw decided to NURTURE the TALENT by enrolling him with an artist, who will MENTOR and TRAIN him so that his TALENT can boom.
This attribute that his mother showed is not learnt at Harvard. 
As a matter of truth, the most sophisticated and learned mothers/fathers don’t have it; they are shallow. 
They only understand the place of academics so they put their kids in an expensive school and pay for them to do another LESSON during breaks, especially the end-of-session break that is fast approaching and bug their heads with books without any opportunity to nurture the creative in them. 
Every single soul on earth has a TALENT and for most of them, without proper mentoring, they will miss it.
Another thing is, she understands the role of TALENT before HARD WORK. 
Let me tell you another story. 
You remember Olajumoke and ‘Taju goes to School’, right? 
Well, Olajumoke became famous for photo-bombing a prominent British model’s photo-shoot and fame smiled on her. 
However, Olajumoke, though hardworking, has a no visible talent that we can pin her to. 
She is amazing and hardworking but what is her TALENT? 
What does she have to give to SUSTAIN the FAME?
And you will notice that where Olamilekan was recognized, Olajumoke wasn’t. 
Olajumoke was popular on Nigerian social media and media stations but Olamilekan got a global recognition with top media stations. 
One of his videos has over 4.5 million views. I was elated. 
I was screaming and showing hubby the statistic.
After the BBC Africa interview, BBC International showed him and Aljazeera, not wanting to duplicate BBC’s video, came to interview him too. 
You can imagine the role of talent. 
It’s like saying Olajumoke should come back and photo-bomb. 
It’s simply not achievable. But with talent, you can have a ‘come-back-to’ factor every time.
The Bible says “a man’s gift makes way for him and makes him stand before Kings and not mere men”. 
And I always tell hubby that TALENT before HARD WORK. 
It’s when you understand the TALENT you have that you can now put in HARD WORK.
Hard work has it reward and it sometimes comes late but TALENT is a show-stopper. 
TALENT catapults you into greatness. 
Talk about Ronaldo or Serana Williams and the many talents around us.
I keep screaming it, parents need to do more. Olamilekan may not be the most brilliant boy in his class. 
He may not even be going to a private school for all you know, but he has a mother who knows what greatness smells like and I tell you, greatness is not in wealth or in books but in the mental growth of everyone. 
The day we all realize that we need to first know the talent that God has given us and how to nurture it, that is the day we have stopped EXISTING and have started LIVING.
Olamilekan’s story can never remain the same again. 
He said: “I want to be like Michelangelo. and I was like ‘Tosin, how did he know this guy?’ 
Looking at his background, who told him the story of the great artist?
Who are the ones your kids want to be like? 
Who are the people your kids live up to? 
Who are they?
 What story are you relating to them? 
You think if his mother was telling him about Slay Queen, he will know Michelangelo? 
What are you saying around your kids?
And summer break is coming, some people are thinking of enrolling their kids in school again. 
Some are thinking otherwise.
What are you thinking? What on earth are you thinking?
I have said it million times, in 20 years, we are going to see the reward of our investments.

The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide
The Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to “make America great again,” as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War.
You probably know who I am talking about. 
The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?
Not by a long shot. 
The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.
You would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. 
In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.
Evidently, Mr Bichi’s DSS has become a major threat to the norms and values of a democratic system. 
The time has come for Mr Yusuf Bichi to step down as the head of the organisation.     
We hereby demand that he should immediately step down as boss of the DSS. 
We also demand that the DSS tenders a public apology to the judiciary for its unwarranted assault on the sacred institution."
Sade Adu’s Child Completes Transition From Female To Male
Thank you for staying by my side these past six months Mumma. 
Thank you for fighting with me to complete the man I am.
Child of British-Nigerian singer, Sade Adu, Izaak, has completed the transition from female to male following the success of a phalloplasty (a plastic surgery to construct a penis).
In an emotional message on his Instagram handle on Thursday, Izaak, who is the only child of the soulful singer from her former relationship with reggae music producer, Bob Morgan, expressed gratitude to Adu for sticking by him throughout the process.
He shared a picture of himself hugging his mom upon his return home after the successful surgery.
Alongside the picture, he wrote. “It’s been a long, hard road but we did it. We are coming home.
“Thank you for staying by my side these past six months Mumma. Thank you for fighting with me to complete the man I am.
“Thank you for your encouragement when things are hard, for the love you give me. 
The purest heart. 
I love you so much.”
In 2016, Izaak came out as transgender to coincide with National Coming Out Day.
Set Your Ovaries Free', President Tells Women
He said a higher birth rate would achieve faster progress.
John Magufuli, Tanzania's President has called on women to "set your ovaries free" and bear more children so that the country can enjoy demographic dividends.
Magufuli, who cited Nigeria and China as examples, said, "When you have a big population you build the economy. That's why China's economy is so huge.
I know that those who like to block ovaries will complain about my remarks. 
Set your ovaries free, let them block theirs.
Aljazeera reports that since taking office in 2015, Magufuli has launched an industrialization campaign that has helped buoy economic growth, which has averaged six to seven percent annually in recent years.
He said a higher birth rate would achieve faster progress.
Shoprite Will Suffer From Xenophobic Attacks, Says Analyst
The multinational has seen its shops attacked in Nigeria and also fell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, along with telecoms firm, MTN.
An analyst at Mergence Investment Managers in Cape Town, South Africa, Nolwandle Mthombeni, has said that consumer retail chain, Shoprite, will be hard hit by recent reprisal attacks on South African businesses across several countries on the continent.
The multinational has seen its shops attacked in Nigeria and also fell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, along with telecoms firm, MTN.
He told Bloomberg South Africa that, “From footage I’ve seen, it most definitely will hit Shoprite hard because it goes beyond lost sales, but also cost of repairs and restoring the damage.”
Leaders of Congo DR, Rwanda, Zambia, Nigeria and a few others boycotted the World Economic Forum summit holding in South Africa.
The Nigerian Government has also asked the South African Government to pay compensation for damages done to Nigerian businesses in the country.
Over 50 shops owned by nationals of other African countries including Nigerians were broken into and looted by South Africans in a spate of attacks that started on Sunday.
Several Nigerians had been murdered before those attacks started.
A Sick Nation And Her Sickening Secret Service By Erasmus Ikhide
How best do we describe a beastly secret service or its operatives whose beastiality threatens national cohesion, the nation's constitution and the judiciary, democracy and its majestic ethos?
The citizens' clarion call that the Department of State Services should be scrapped forthwith by the act of National Assembly and its operatives from top to bottom debriefed; re-educated, even rusticated or redistributed to other minimally functional paramilitary institutions like the Nigeria Police Force will no doubt heals the nation of the wounds from the vested madness and brutality the secret service has visited on the failed state called Nigeria.
How best do we describe a beastly secret service or its operatives whose beastiality threatens national cohesion, the nation's constitution and the judiciary, democracy and its majestic ethos? 
Who need an obsolete self-serving stone age anti-democratic security outfit, with scant methodology on intelligence gathering, lacking in cybernetics sophistry without a single idea on how to tame real and actual security threats to the nation?
The DSS needs internal purgation, and urgently too. 
Someone like Peter Afunanya, its spokesperson, should be thrown out of the window for further disgracing an ethically flawed institution which knew next to nothing about intelligence gathering, solely masquerading as an attack dog for the presidency.
The conundrum has been why furnish and burnish criminal government with false intelligence reports against the citizens when the real enemy of the state is the same vampire government? 
I have laboured in the past to educate the DSS and her collaborators that its protective alibi labelled "national security" is a mere subterfuge. 
The actual name is "regime security" coded as "national security" to defraud and cow uninformed citizens to submission. 
Citizens must not be given order by lawless secret service that can not differentiate between Boko Haram and social change agents and activists.
Tragically, Peter Afunanya is a poor image maker for the DSS with his amateurish defence and blatant falsehood he puts forward on the several viral videos that signposted the desecration of the hall of justice at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday by the DSS.
Afunanya couldn't hide the fact that doing the bidding of a murderous tyrant is different from protective media anchorage. 
He could still not give valid reasons or answers as to why the DSS rearrested Omoyele Sowore after less than 24 hours after he was released on bail.
Like the ostrich that he is, Afunanya buried his head and that of the DSS in the sand without a word on the abduction of the journalist and human rights activist in a bizarre and gangly despotic manner. 
Afunanya spilled poor half-truth on the secret service disgraceful outing without mentioning the commando-like but shameful exhibition of empty power in the midst of defenceless citizens.
What's the usefulness of a discredited ethnically cultivated and motivated compromised secret service that could not decipher or detect activities of murderous militias like Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen long before they unleash terror on the nation? 
What's the DSS's day job when cultists kill themselves and cause mayhem on a daily basis across the country? 
What inform DSS open contempt for the judiciary and the law, if not misplaced intelligence computation, analysis and misplaced priority?
It's time the National Assembly revisits the law that established the DSS for taking sadistic pleasure in dehumanising Nigerians. 
The DSS needs complete restructuring or outright scrapping from its present banality and rescue it away from being an appendage of any president in power or unlisted powerful individuals at the corridors of power.
Without that, Nigerians would wake up one day and be told that the notorious scofflaw has created her own law courts where they (the DSS) can now do maximum violence to Nigerian citizens, democracy and civilisation.

Simi Vs Victor Uwaifo: The True Story Of 'Joromi'
Simi is being sued for N50 million damages for using the word 'Joromi' in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.
Joromi' was the same song title Uwaifo gave to his 1979 global hit.
In recent times, Nigerian singer Simi has had her name mentioned several times by Nigerian legendary guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, over what he claimed to be a copyright infringement of his song, 'Joromi'.
Simi is being sued for N50 million damages for using the word 'Joromi' in her song and as the title of one of her tracks.
'Joromi' was the same song title Uwaifo gave to his 1979 global hit.
The case between both artistes is generating debates on what constitutes copyright infringement.
Amidst this, SaharaReporters visited the historical 'Revelation Tourist Palazzo' built and developed by Uwaifo where it was revealed that the name 'Joromi' was not just the title of a song but the name of a famous fighter from Benin.
Giving a tour of the centre, the curator, Chris Eburu, said prior to the death of Joromi’s father, he warned Joromi not to climb the palm tree located at the backyard of the house.
However, Joromi defied this order and met his death in the hands of a masquerade in hellfire.Eburu said: "Joromi was a famous wrestler in Benin. 
He dislodged everyone who dared him. He was the champion. 
When his father was about to die, the only thing he bequeathed to his son was a warning.
“He warned him never to climb the palm tree at the backyard but when the father died, on one Sunday afternoon as Joromi was taking a stroll around his father’s backyard he spotted this particular palm tree and looked at it pensively and began to wonder why his father told him not to climb the palm tree.
“The daring Joromi climbed on top of it while his sister turned into a fly and accompanied him. 
When they eventually got to the zenith of that tree, they grew out of the natural state and they landed in a place called 'hell' where Joromi noticed with dismay that the least person in hell had two heads but Joromi wanted to fight, the battle line was drawn.
"Continuing the myth, the curator said, “From one to the other, he conquered all of them from the one that had two heads then to the ones that had six heads he destroyed all of them plucking off their extra heads and telling them categorically that they were better off having one head."
'Who asked you to have more than one (head)? 
On earth, we have one head. 
Who asked you to have more than one head?' Joromi queried but when the seven-headed spirit, Ugbogweli appeared - in fact, he was breathing and smoking fire all over him - that was when Joromi sister began to sing.
"Joromi once more turned deaf ears and for the first time as he ran down to the battle line, he witnessed a bitter piece of death for the very first time. 
Life was off him and the man called Joromi died.
"However, Eburu said, "Luckily for him, the sister spotted a leaf that had life in it. 
She plucked it, squeezed it and subsequently applied the juice on the five senses of the brother who now regained consciousness.
"This time when he stood up he was no longer ready to fight and he began to race back to earth but Ugbogweli would never let him go. 
When he got to the bridge between hellfire and earth and was about to cross to the latter, Ugbogweli stretched his hand to grab Joromi but luckily for Joromi Ugbogweli could run his fingers down the back of Joromi.
"The curator then made a curious statement: "Those of us in this part of the world hold the belief that the encounter that Joromi had with Ugbogweli is the cause of the spines humans have."
Sowore: Court Invasion, Manifestation Of Failed Democracy -ADC Chair
We have seen these signs creeping into the system for many years, not even a few months ago and it’s giving us serious concern. 
It has come out in full blast.
Omoyele Sowore
BBC
National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress, Ralph Nwosu, has condemned the rearrest of pro-democracy activist and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, describing it as a manifestation of failed democracy.
The Department of State Services rearrested Sowore in the courtroom of Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, barely 24 hours after he was released from detention.
The action has attracted criticisms from both local and international organisations but the Nigerian Government said it was not bothered.
In an interview with PUNCH, Nwosu said, “What happened in court was a clear manifestation of a completely failed democracy. 
It is also a clear case of fascism and it is even fascism of a questionable leadership.
“We have seen these signs creeping into the system for many years, not even a few months ago and it’s giving us serious concern. 
It has come out in full blast.
“When autocratic governments start, there will be different kinds of pretentiousness, but by the time they lay out their full fangs, there is trouble.
So, people must stand for the country, and we commend a major organisation like PUNCH for standing for the country.     
“All of them should be sanctioned, so long as you are serving under this government because it is supposed to be a democracy.     
“The moment it is no longer a democracy, it’s either you are part of the autocratic and disruptive element or you are not part of it. 
And if you are not part of it, you would have to quit.     
“So, anybody who was in doubt before and continues to be part of the government after what happened in the court should be sanctioned.”     
Sowore: DSS' Incompetence And The Docility Of The National Assembly By Martin White-Ufuah.
We are presently under the attack of cyber espionages, but because the DSS do not have the structural competence to checkmate the economic security threat of foreign espionages in our country's internet space, they do not know the danger their activities portend for our country.     
With DSS' bold outlaw, subnormal intelligence, defective disposition, and outright violation of different court orders, it has become indisputably clear that Nigeria's democracy has been militarised.     
The 9th rubber-stamp National Assembly that is supposed to restrain the overreaching extents of the executive has openly obliged to doing the bidding of the executive.     
Obviously, the legislative arm of government in Nigeria has transformed itself into a branch of the executive.     
Today, the only distinguishing characteristic of our bogus democracy from the military dictatorship is that we waste tax payers’ money to service an institution (National Assembly) that is tractable to executive rascality.     
Our democracy is a charade!     
If it isn't, the illegal detention of Omoyele Sowore and other Nigerians by the DSS should have been a topical discourse in the National Assembly to check the excesses of the executive.     
Nigeria is currently perplexed, bedevilled and overwhelmed by the lethality of human right abuses that ridicules and exposes our own brand of democracy as a fraud.     
Instead of a vibrantly energetic and engaging legislature that imposes a legislative sanction on the DSS' boss and the country's attorney-general over the illegal detention of Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, they are vigorously pursuing bills on hate speech and social media regulation.     
The National Assembly is sleeping on duty!     
The DSS should be publicly condemned for its chronic law-breaking antecedence.     
By the unlawful gestapo arrest, clandestine and illegal detention and persecution of Omoyele Sowore, the Department of State Service, has shown that it is markedly subnormal in function, flawed in intelligence and rascal in behaviour.     
The criminal-classed elements sponsored by state actors that took up arms against the Nigerian state during the Kogi and Bayelsa elections were never seen to have committed treasonable felony.     
But Omoyele Sowore who only sued for peace by calling on Nigerians to pour out in their numbers to protest against misrule and corruption is being accused of plotting to unseat the government.     
What a joke of a country!     
Obviously, the DSS is merely a political stooge that react against voices of truth that attempt to call the government to order.     
Instead of a vibrantly energetic and engaging domestic intelligence agency that functions as the source of reliable information for mitigating our various internal security challenges, our moribund DSS is all about the pettiness of political arrests and illegal detentions of honourable citizens.     
The calculated use of violence against our country by Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram members and other criminal groups with felonious intent have never for once been comprehended by the radar coverage of our so-called DSS domestic intelligence.     
Isn't that a big shame?     
The DSS has shown that it does not have the structural competence and expertise for espionages and information gathering. 
That is why the agency relies on online gossips and maliciously divulged information to clamp on citizens.     
Domestic intelligence service is also supposed to be responsible for identifying foreign spies employed by foreign services against a country.     
Every day we hear of other countries exposing and apprehending foreign spies and agents employed by foreign intelligence services against their government.     
Please, how many has the DSS caught? None! Why? 
They think their job is to go after Omoyele Sowore.     
If the DSS understand the danger foreign espionages poses to our country, they'd resign from their pettiness and become serious for once.     
Some foreign espionages have access to our country's internet space without anyone knowing their identity.     
They are sometimes the ones spreading propagandas and disinformation on our local internet space to cause dissension and unrest.     
We are presently under the attack of cyber espionages, but because the DSS do not have the structural competence to checkmate the economic security threat of foreign espionages in our country's internet space, they do not know the danger their activities portend for our country.    
I'm writing this to tell the DSS to release Omoyele Sowore right now with an apology to him because he is not a terrorist.

Sowore: Government Has Ordered Investigation Into Invasion Of Court By DSS -Malami     
Sowore was arrested in the court by the DSS less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after a third order by the court.     
Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has revealed that the Nigerian Government has ordered an investigation into the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by operatives of the Department of State Services to rearrest Omoyele Sowore.     
Sowore was arrested in the court by the DSS less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after a third order by the court.     
Malami was questioned by reporters when he was seen at the premises of the Federal High Court, Abuja.    
When asked why he was in court, Malami said he did not come because of Sowore but to congratulate the judge on being confirmed as the substantive Chief Judge of the court.     
He however, revealed that the government had instituted a panel to investigate the invasion of the court.     
Asked if he was not appalled by the DSS’ conduct, Malami said, “Whatever affects the integrity of the court is a worrisome issue for us.     
“I can never be preemptive of an incident over which I was not a live witness to.     
“But one thing I am certain of is that the government has put in place mechanism for investigation of the reported incident.     
“So, I would not like to be preemptive in terms of a conclusion, one way or the other, without allowing the consummation and conclusion of the investigation process.”    
Sowore: Nigeria Has A Way Of Punishing The Innocent, Says Banky W     “Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and trampling on the rights, dreams and hopes of the regular citizens.
Nigerian musician, Bankole Wellington popularly known as Banky W, has reacted to the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday ordering the Department of State Services to immediately release pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore, on bail.
In a statement on Tuesday, Banky-W described Nigeria as a county that prides itself in punishing the innocent.
He said, “I'm so thankful that our justice system made the right call by granting the release of Omoyele Sowore.
“Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and trampling on the rights, dreams and hopes of the regular citizens.
“Every time our leaders do wrong and get away with it, we lose a little piece of our soul.
“We become numb, we lose hope, and we subconsciously accept that this is how things are and there's nothing we can say or do to change it.
“You didn't need to be a voter or volunteer for Mr Sowore to see that this was clearly an infringement on a basic human right and a grave injustice.
“Freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest is the unassailable right of every Nigerian citizen.
“May God bless those in our justice system who stood on the right side of history by doing the right thing.
“May God strengthen, comfort and bless Sowore, his wife and family as they have endured the most difficult of times while only being guilty of attempting to speak up for a better Nigeria.”
Sowore Is Our Benefactor, Not A Criminal –Ondo Students
Irinyemi stated that the Sowore Scholarship Foundation, which had helped many parents in the state to send their children to school, has been stopped since he was arrested and detained by the DSS.
A group of students in Ondo State have taken to the streets to protest the continued detention of the pro-democracy activist and Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, by the Department of State Services.
The students, under the platform of the National Association of Kiribo Students, said that the continued detention of Sowore should be rejected by all lovers of Nigeria.
The protesters marched all the way to Idepe Town under Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state, chanting songs of solidarity and calling for the immediate release of Sowore, who had made scholarship offers available to them over the years.
According to the students, the recent declaration of Sowore and Olawale Bakare as "prisoners of conscience" by Amnesty International, has showed that the pro-democracy activist was being recognised globally as one of the few Africans that have demonstrated doggedness.
Spokesperson for the protesting students, Samuel Irinyemi, told SaharaReporters that many of them benefiting from Sowore's scholarship programme had continued to feel his continued detention.
He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to obey court orders by mandating the security agency to release Sowore to his family.
Irinyemi, “We are just a few of the many students benefiting directly from Omoyele Sowore's scholarship foundation in Ondo State.
We are sad that our brother and great benefactor was arrested and had since been detained by the DSS over frivolous charges. 
Sowore is not a criminal because we know his history very well.     
“This is a man that placed many of us on scholarship with his personal money and made it possible for us to have education.     
“I have been benefiting from his kind gesture for close to five years now.     
So, we are not happy about his continued detention despite court orders granting his release.
We are pleading with President Buhari to release Sowore from the detention of the DSS.     
“Sowore that we know is a freedom fighter and he means well for Nigeria as a country.”     
Sowore was arrested in Lagos on August 3, 2019 for calling on Nigerians to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations to demand a better country from the administration of President Buhari.     
The government is accusing him of insulting Buhari and planning to topple his regime through the planned protests.     
Despite two orders by the Federal High Court, Abuja, directing the DSS to release him on bail since that period, the activist has remained in government detention, attracting condemnation from around the world.     
Sowore: Sultan Of Sokoto Tells Buhari To Obey Court Orders.     
Abubakar said nobody can decide to disregard the court at will, adding that it would be detrimental to national development.     
The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, has told President Muhammadu Buhari and all those in his regime to obey court orders because according to him failure to do so holds dire consequences.     
The Sultan gave the warning while speaking at the 2019 fourth quarter meeting of the Nigeria Inter-religious Council in Abuja.    
Abubakar said nobody can decide to disregard the court at will, adding that it would be detrimental to national development.     
He said, “We must regularly obey and respect the laws of our land.     
We should never disregard the laws to avoid the consequences.
If a court makes a judicial pronouncement on a particular matter, it should be obeyed to the letter.     
“If you have any problem or disagree with the pronouncement, the next step is to appeal the pronouncement instead of disregarding or violating court judgments.     
If you are served a court order and you deliberately refused to obey it because you are a governor, president or any influential person, then you are setting a dangerous precedent."
The Nigerian Government has failed to release Omoyele Sowore, disregarding two court orders by two different judges.
Sowore was rearrested at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday by operatives of the Department of State Services less than 24 hours after he was released on bail after 125 days in detention.
The invasion of the court and refusal to obey court orders has by President Buhari’s regime has been condemned from around the world.
The government is accusing him of insulting President Muhammadu Buhari and planning to bring down his regime.
Soyinka: 'Sowore, Welcome To The Club' As Nobel Laureate Slams Buhari Regime As Being Paranoid
The Buhari regime had on Friday filed seven counts of treasonable
felony and money laundering against Sowore.
Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, says the President Muhammadu Buhari regime has attained an “unprecedented level of paranoia” following the charges of treason filed against human rights activist,Omoyele Sowore.
In a statement on Saturday, Soyinka said the nation had failed tolearn from past experiences.He said, “This is utterly depressing news. 
So, the Sowore affair has moved beyond harassment and taken on a sinister direction. 
Outside the country where I happened to be engaged at the moment, I can testify that the immediate reaction around me was to dismiss this as yet another grotesque product of fake news, of which Nigerians have becomethe greatest practitioners. 
I confess that I also joined in this school of thought – at the start.
“Further checks have however confirmed that this government has indeed attained an unprecedented level of paranoia. 
I do not believe that the justice department itself believes in these improbable charges, asformally publicized.
"So, once again, we inscribe in our annals another season of treasonable felony. 
History still guards some lessons we have yet to digest, much less from which to learn. 
Welcome to the Club, Mr.Omoyele Sowore.”
The Buhari regime had on Friday filed seven counts of treasonable felony and money laundering against Sowore.
The charges were filed a day before the expiration of the detentionorder of the Federal High Court in Abuja permitting the Department of State Services to keep the activist for 45 days.
SPECIAL REPORT: Why Troops Are Losing Ground To ISWAP
Is the 2018 military strategy and campaign working? 
The facts based on the number of military formations successfully attacked and overran by ISWAP in 2018 in the areas of its dominance is 70 percent. 
What this translates into is that out of 20 military bases in these territories, ISWAP have either sacked by overrunning or forced the military to shut down a total of 14 bases in 2018 alone. 
The only time this ratio of attacks and takeovers came close to the 2018 numbers was in 2014. 
By the end of 2015 it was below 50% success ratio, which further dropped in 2016 and 2017, only to witness a sharp surge in 2018.
In the few days leading to the eclipse on 2018, reports from the warfront in North East Nigeria provoked huge concerns, fiercely stirring panic within communities in and around Maiduguri, Borno state. 
Governor Kashim Shettima, within this period, quickly called an emergency security meeting to receive briefs from different security commands in the state. 
At the Executive chambers of the Government House, Maiduguri, the seat of power in the state, the situation was grim and faces drawn.
In fact, the situation appeared so dire as Nigerian troops facing the onslaught of the combined affront of insurgency from terror groups, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram forces, beat a steady retreat, incurring monumental losses of locational facilities. 
Within two weeks, the Nigerian troops had retreated tactically or been overrun in strategic military bases. 
Out of 20 military bases in northern and central Borno where Nigerian troops were in control, 14 had been overrun or altogether shut down.
Does the recent string of losses by the military represent a momentary setback likely to be overturned swiftly by the military or is the trend a fore-test of an uncertain future? 
All diplomatic and international military platforms knowledgeable about the escalating conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin affirm that at no time since the surge of violence in the region have the terrorists been in command of the level of weapons available to them today. 
Two developments explain this.
The terror groups, in recent times, have received a flush of funds from ransom paid to them allegedly by the government. 
Equally, there has been a steady access to unimaginable cache of military weaponry, including hardware and ammunition from bases overran by the insurgents, remarkably bolstering their war chest. 
For instance, the loss of the International Military Task Force Base, headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, headed by an Army General, is reported as monumental, not merely in the loss, of location but because of the massive military hardware and ammunition only comparable to what is available to the Military Division in Maiduguri, to ISWAP.
The insurgents are obviously riding the momentum and are motivated in manners that are completely alien to the military. 
According to a recent report by the AFP, in no year since the upsurge of conflicts in the North East have Nigerian troops been exposed to the level of casualties inflicted on them by the insurgents in 2018 alone. 
With an enlarged war chest, a strategic control of the economic mainstay of the Chad Basin cross cutting fishing, all season farming, water and control of cross border trade routes, the insurgents are looking formidable.
No wonder, they have recently scaled up recruitment of new fighters across both English and French speaking countries in the surrounding countries of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. 
Information gleaned from contacts within the fold of ISWAP paint an insight that seems to have challenged the position of politicians and the military in respect of holding territory. 
ISWAP always considered the territories of Northern and Central Borno their Caliphate territories. 
The presence of the Nigerian troops and particularly military bases were considered invasion by the military.
Bidding their time until they had adequate ammunition with additional army of motivated fighters to unleash new wave of violence the group was willing to stay under the radar for a few years before drawing the line on the sand. 
Their long wait paid off in 2018. 
They have been on the offensive all of 2018. 
The ISWAP’s strategy is to put everything available to ensure that military presence in those territories they consider part of their caliphate is made ever untenable. 
ISWAP considers all parts of north and central Borno as its caliphate and territory and therefore obligated by doctrines and commandment to repel every external aggression within the territory.
This is irrespective of whatever politicians and the military claim is the situation within those territories. 
In fact, Boko Haram / ISWAP policy with respect to physically holding territories changed after the steady losses they suffered in the run up to general elections in Nigeria in 2014. 
They do not want to physically hold unto territories anymore than they are determined to ensure that the military does not have any sustainable presence in the territories. 
Furthermore, ISWAP is paying more premium to wooing local communities to feel more secure with them than they could ever be with the military. 
That is their strategy.
They have secured the economic lines in the territories they control. 
The Lake Chad territories have become more fertile for famers and more viable for commercial fishing activities. 
They have largely crippled the fish and onions markets in Maiduguri. 
In its stead, they have opened secured trading locations in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic and another in Kusiri, in Cameroon. 
Nigerian traders rely on the market in Kusiri, Cameroon through Mubi, in Adamawa. 
The other in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic. 
The Nigerian market in Hadeja, Jigawa state depend heavily on the market in Niger Republic.
Nigerian troops apparently would rather confiscate a trader’s wares, forcibly take their livestock for their feeding than device any system of commercial comfort that would help them grow their business. 
It therefore seems not far-fetched that several local communities appear to cooperate better with ISWAP than with the Nigerian troops. 
ISWAP want to primarily make it unattractive and too expensive in terms of body count and loss of hardware for the military to maintain a base in any of these territories. 
They calculate that as long as they continually target and attack military formations, forcing them to beat a retreat so long would it be easier for local communities to accept that they are more secure in the territories under them than under the cover of Nigerian troops.
Moreover, they envisage that for as long as they sustain the push back against the military for so long will it be difficult for the demoralized troops to muster confidence to put them at tactical disadvantage anytime soon. 
Is the 2018 military strategy and campaign working? 
The facts based on the number of military formations successfully attacked and overran by ISWAP in 2018 in the areas of its dominance is 70 percent. 
What this translates into is that out of 20 military bases in these territories, ISWAP have either sacked by overrunning or forced the military to shut down a total of 14 bases in 2018 alone. 
The only time this ratio of attacks and takeovers came close to the 2018 numbers was in 2014. 
By the end of 2015 it was below 50% success ratio, which further dropped in 2016 and 2017, only to witness a sharp surge in 2018.
The outlook of the map in the battle theatres is grim. 
The territories that constitute Northern Borno are 10 Local Government Areas lying north of Maiduguri and bearing natural land borders with three countries namely Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon. 
ISWAP have full sway in these territories currently. 
The territories that constitute Borno Central are made up of eight Local Government Areas, and both ISWAP and Boko Haram have significant footholds in these territories. 
Southern Borno, made up of nine Local Government Areas, is the least affected, with the exception of flashpoints such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok. 
With barely 45 days to presidential election in Nigeria there seems to be more energy at official quarters to cover up the tragic situation than acknowledging it.
The military have rightly stated that ISWAP may not be holding most of the territories where it overran its bases, especially the town of Baga. 
ISWAP, on its part, is also right when it says it has sacked soldiers from the areas it attacked, including Baga. 
Neither the military nor the insurgents have the manpower and capacity to hold and govern over these large expanse of land sustainably. 
But in desisting from building visible administrative and military structures in the areas of their primary interest ISWAP have evolved in a way that is difficult for Nigerian troops to track. 
On the other hand, by being fixated with claim of control of territories the military have only succeeded in making its troops sitting ducks and easy targets of the enemy.
More clearly, ISWAP is no longer showing interest in taking a formidable military base such as was in Baga and staying put there. 
It doesn’t apparently serve their tactical and strategic interest well. 
They are more interested in taking over military hardware and ammunition in those bases while instilling fear on the troops and making it extremely difficult for the military to have the comfort to plan and launch attacks. 
For instance, two days after overrunning the military base in Baga, the ISWAP moved out of location with military hardware and ammunition. 
According to knowledgeable sources, the objective is not to necessarily capture and hold new territories, what is far more strategic to ISWAP is to continually “unsettle the military in their bases across the Lake Chad region.”
There is no better indication to the effectiveness of the tactical approach of ISWAP against the military than seeing that Nigerian troops in the troubled locations are unable to undertake patrol duties. 
Rather, they are mostly in the trenches practically waiting for the next attack. 
One troubling outcome of this is the escalating number of troops on desertion charge. 
For instance, in just one detention centre in Jos, Plateau state, there are over 20 military deserters rounded up and detained. 
Similarly, a growing army of deserters are being held across major military detention facilities in the country. 
Obviously embarrassed at this turn of events, the military authorities are zealously covering up on these.
An Army officer currently hospitalized lamented that “soldiers have become cannon fodders,” revealing:"There are more soldiers deserting their commission over Boko Haram war. 
I can count dozens in my unit alone that escaped after they survived an attack.” 
The Nigerian Police Force are embroiled in similar matter with 121 officers of the rank-and-file who reportedly deserted in protest against planned deployment to the warfront dismissed with immediate effect.
The Inspector-General Ibrahim Idris, according to a report in Premium Times (December 28, 2018), ordered their dismissal. 
“The Police are very kind to their officers for dismissing them, we are not that lucky because after we attempted to escape, we were arrested and detained without trial for several months,” said a soldier detained in one of Special Task Force (STF) detention centers in Jos. 
He was arrested after he absconded along with scores of his colleagues from the warfront.
A confident Army Captain in the frontlines who spoke with our reporter on condition of anonymity extolled the troops for their gallantry on several occasions. 
He said that unlike the terrorists, the military do not carry cameras into the battlefront to record gun exchanges. 
According to him there are far more attacks on military bases and units by the terrorists that were repelled than the ones in which the locations were overrun. 
“The terrorists go to battles with cameras, while we, as a matter of policy don’t.”
Nevertheless, he contends that Nigerians do not care about the number of insurgents that we have killed, “the killing of soldiers that protect the country’s sovereignty constitute a source of concern, what this means is, if soldiers continue to die, Nigeria itself may fail to exist,” he concludes.
Some of these attacks were so overwhelming that the bases were overrun with hundreds of casualties. 
According to multiple media reports, not less than 1,000 soldiers were killed in 2018. 
These casualty figures do not include soldiers killed in Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and in Southern Borno. 
“In fact, there has never been a year soldiers were killed more than in 2018; not even 2013 and 2014 did we see the kind of casualties we experienced today,” said another soldier who doubles as a medical doctor in Maiduguri. 
More traumatizing for soldiers, according to ISWAP sources, are the humiliating experience of scores of abducted soldiers compelled to tutor the insurgents on new weapons handling before they are enslaved or executed.
Informed sources state that the military facility in Monguno is probably the only larest operational base outside of Maiduguri presently that is unaffected. 
Four or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, while Damasak is manned by the Multi-National Joint Task Force at the border with Niger republic. 
According to a serving military officer currently hospitalized, “the soldiers in most of these bases have all taken up defensive positions to protect their turfs and can hardly venture outside to patrol or engage in any offensive attack”.
Just like the officers deserting, the Military itself has long abandoned any mentality of “no retreat, no surrender,’ having steadily been on the retreat from several military bases. 
Weeks ago, they shut down two bases in Gudumbali and Kukawa. 
“We retreated to Monguno before Baga was attacked. 
Now, some soldiers and residents are running away from Monguno to Maiduguri,” reported a soldier in Shagari Low Cost Housing Estate in Maiduguri. 
He highlights the utter helplessness of the soldiers: what is disturbing is the effrontery of “ISWAP in making sure that we are fully made aware of their plans ahead of any attack. 
There was never an attack that we don’t see in advance, yet we are helpless,” he lamented.
In the midst of these setbacks, military fat cats are feeding exceedingly well on account of the war. 
On 28, December, 2018 the Defence and Foreign Affairs of the International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) based in the United States stated that “the conduct of the war in the North (East of Nigeria) is tied to the corruption in the military, and (President) Buhari - ring-fenced by his own team - is unable to tackle the issue". 
ISSA, the Washington-based non-governmental organization with a worldwide membership of professionals involved in national and international security and strategy, stated that massive corruption among top military chiefs appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari is the reason Nigeria is losing the war against Boko Haram.
According to the report, the only significant engagement which the Nigerian military leadership seems determined to fight “is to stop the leakage of information about massive corruption, running into the equivalent of several billions of dollars, in the purchase by senior military officers of major military capital goods and military consumables, including the troops’ own food.” 
More than anything, it is the noticeable resurgence of the Lake Chad and the commercial viability of the territories under ISWAP that present the greatest pull on individuals in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps to return to their villages. 
But for others, it is their ability to put out a good fight and sometimes win with an Army that enjoys global support, that is the biggest inspiration that makes many want to join. 
A recent recruit and a Francophone citizen said, “ISWAP's fortunes only means one thing, Allah with us.” 
Another who abandoned his rich family business in Kano to become a fighter said, “I have no doubt Angels are fighting with us, otherwise there is nothing that explains our victories.”
In the light of these realities, should the Nigerian Military continue with the tactical mentality that is leading them into embarrassing losses? 
For a government that has made so much premium of a claim on its control of territory from the insurgents, what these developments point to is probably worse than a setback. 
Efforts by independent observers to point out the evidently skewed tactical mentality have been visited with official hostility. 
Local and international Civil Society Organizations and the media have, for these reasons, come under attack by the military. 
For calling the Military out on its ignoble human rights abuses, including rape and extra judicial executions, Amnesty International and other Human Rights organizations have been targeted for official harassment.
Despite a consistent stream of global ratings and reports about Nigeria’s crisis, notable among them being the 2018 Global Terrorism Index in which Nigeria emerged the third most terrorized nation globally, both the Military and politicians in government have carried on as if this was of no consequence. 
The index placed Nigeria behind war-torn countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and ahead of Syria and Pakistan. 
However, the report also showed a 16% drop in the number of deaths linked to terrorism in 2017 from previous year.
Also, the World Economic Forum, in its biennial tourism report with the specific section focusing on safety and security, recently ranked Nigeria as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 
Amid all these disturbing realities the local media generally have caved in to a new sense of self censorship promoted by the Nigerian military, which is, “stop reporting the killings to dissuade Boko Haram from further killings” instead of, prevent the insurgents from killings in the first place, so that, there wouldn’t be any death to report.

SSS Is Indeed A Lying Machine By Stanley Imhanruor
Since the barbaric and misguided act by the SSS was well captured on tape, it is pertinent to reference some of the pictures and videos circulating in the media space.
I have read with amusement, the press release by the SSS wherein the service unashamedly denied any attempt to rearrest Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare in the well of the court.
Since the barbaric and misguided act by the SSS was well captured on tape, it is pertinent to reference some of the pictures and videos circulating in the media space.
In the viral video, the person holding Sowore down (the man that eventually emerged beneath Sowore, wearing white shirt and a black jacket is an officer of the SSS.
Everyone could see from the viral video that when the arresting officer got up people where asking him: who are you? 
Who are you? But the officer refused to respond to the posers.
The officer is also arrowed in some of the viral pictures circulating on social media platforms.
The said officer is constantly around Sowore in the courtroom and he is the officer obviously detailed by the SSS to always be with Sowore in the courtroom to monitor his movement and conduct whenever the matter comes up in court whilst other officers stay some metres away watching.
For clarity, the officer's name in question is Dekko Nelly (Marshal).
Please do not be deceived by the press release by the SSS as same is merely a smokescreen designed to save its already badly battered image locally and internationally in the circumstance.
No matter how far and fast a lie travels, truth which is eternal and immutable will always overtake it in the long run.
Stop Attacking Shoprite In Nigeria, They're Owned By Nigerians -Expert Warns
He added that MTN is a publicly-listed company, hence, Nigerians are part of the shareholders and will bear part of the loss of vandalizing the firm's properties.
Rotimi Sankore, a veteran journalist, policy and development expert, has cautioned against the looting of Shoprite, a departmental store, that has been subjected to reprisal attacks following the recent Xenophobic attack in South Africa.
Sankore, who spoke during a journalism MasterClass held by the Civic Media Lab, said the stores being looted are mostly franchises owned by Nigerians.
Shoprite and Spar are mostly franchises. 
Most of the goods on the shelves are owned by Nigerians. 
The staff are Nigerians, he said.
He stated MTN, that has also become the target for the reprisal attacks, is a public listed company hence, Nigerians are part of the shareholders and who bear the part of the loss of vandalising its properties.
He said the Xenophobic attacks are triggered by high unemployment and high crime rates, and not because all South African hated Nigerians.
The veteran journalist also stated how the Nigerian Government could have better handled the Xenophobic attacks against its citizens.
In incidents like this when Nigerians are attacked, what you do is to summon their ambassador and demand that the perpetrators be brought to justice and that the victims be compensated. 
Also demand than police be deployed to protect Nigerians’ shops and businesses from further attacks. 
This would demonstrate to the looters that their actions are not acceptable.     
If they then fail to act, you send the ambassador home and if the attacks continue, you can then take further measures like, seizing assets of the offending countries to compensate victims.”
Sankore said it was the failure of the Nigerian Government to take strategic steps to protect Nigerians that have led to Nigerian citizens resulting to self help and some people taking advantage of the protest to loot shops.
Sudan's Ex-President, Al-Bashir, Sentenced To Two Years For Corruption
The judge handling the case told the court that under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms, the BBC reports.
Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's ex-President, has been sentenced to two years in a social reform facility for corruption.
The judge handling the case told the court that under Sudanese law, people over the age of 70 cannot serve jail terms, the BBC reports.
Bashir also faces charges related to the 1989 coup that brought him to power, genocide, and the killing of protesters before his ousting in April.
During the sentencing, his supporters started chanting that the trial was "political" and were ordered to leave.
They continued their protest outside the court, chanting, "There is no god but God."
It is unclear whether Bashir will be tried over widespread human rights abuses during his time in power, including allegations of war crimes in Darfur.

Talent Vs Hard Work — Lessons From Olamilekan, The 11-Year-Old Who is Macron’s Newfound Friend By Mide Ayeni
You see, Olamilekan has a mother who is futuristic. She understands the dynamics of success. 
Although poor, she is not blind. Olamilekan said: “When I was six, I started drawing. My mother noticed it and took me to an artist to learn under him.” 
First, she understands the place of talent, nurturing, mentoring and hard work. 
She saw a son who loved to draw decided to NURTURE the TALENT by enrolling him with an artist, who will MENTOR and TRAIN him so that his TALENT can boom.
I will tell you a story about talent and hard work. Which should come first?
It's going to be a long read.
First thing, I will also like to re-echo my constant words that “in 20 years’ time, ‘rock bottom’ will produce famous people more than ‘privilege.’”
This afternoon, I had a chat with hubby about Olamilekan, that is the young 11-year-old who met with the President of France and drew his portrait in less than two hours.
Well, let me explain. 
At the Afrika Shrine, where the French President went yesterday, the boy went to work and came out with a perfect portrait of Macron. 
The President was so thrilled that he said “This is exceptional”.
Let's talk about Olamilekan.
He's from a poor background. 
Rock bottom background! 
To most of us who see ourselves as average, Olamilekan sees us as privileged. 
He's so poor that he said: “In his family, they have to toil and sweat before they can put food on the table.” 
So he made a portrait showing a young boy with sweat all over him putting food on his table.
Olamilekan was so emotional when he was speaking to BBC about that art work that I could sense the tears in his words. 
He called it his favourite.
He is barely 11 years and he understands poverty and struggle so much that he could make a picture of it. 
Then you need to understand where he's coming from.
Secondly, if you saw the house where Olamilekan was interviewed, you will understand his roots — his life and his story.
I was drawn to him when I first saw the interview and downloaded the video to share with my son. 
You will also agree that I have posted his videos here more than twice. I was touched.
Let me tell you a secret that many people don't know.
You see, Olamilekan has a mother who is futuristic. 
She understands the dynamics of success. 
Although poor, she is not blind. Olamilekan said: “When I was six, I started drawing. 
My mother noticed it and took me to an artist to learn under him.”
First, she understands the place of talent, nurturing, mentoring and hard work. 
She saw a son who loved to draw decided to NURTURE the TALENT by enrolling him with an artist, who will MENTOR and TRAIN him so that his TALENT can boom.
This attribute that his mother showed is not learnt at Harvard. 
As a matter of truth, the most sophisticated and learned mothers/fathers don’t have it; they are shallow. 
They only understand the place of academics so they put their kids in an expensive school and pay for them to do another LESSON during breaks, especially the end-of-session break that is fast approaching and bug their heads with books without any opportunity to nurture the creative in them. 
Every single soul on earth has a TALENT and for most of them, without proper mentoring, they will miss it.
Another thing is, she understands the role of TALENT before HARD WORK. 
Let me tell you another story. 
You remember Olajumoke and ‘Taju goes to School’, right? 
Well, Olajumoke became famous for photo-bombing a prominent British model’s photo-shoot and fame smiled on her. 
However, Olajumoke, though hardworking, has a no visible talent that we can pin her to. 
She is amazing and hardworking but what is her TALENT? 
What does she have to give to SUSTAIN the FAME?
And you will notice that where Olamilekan was recognized, Olajumoke wasn’t. 
Olajumoke was popular on Nigerian social media and media stations but Olamilekan got a global recognition with top media stations. 
One of his videos has over 4.5 million views. I was elated. 
I was screaming and showing hubby the statistic.
After the BBC Africa interview, BBC International showed him and Aljazeera, not wanting to duplicate BBC’s video, came to interview him too. 
You can imagine the role of talent. 
It’s like saying Olajumoke should come back and photo-bomb. 
It’s simply not achievable. 
But with talent, you can have a ‘come-back-to’ factor every time.
The Bible says “a man’s gift makes way for him and makes him stand before Kings and not mere men”. 
And I always tell hubby that TALENT before HARD WORK. 
It’s when you understand the TALENT you have that you can now put in HARD WORK.
Hard work has it reward and it sometimes comes late but TALENT is a show-stopper. 
TALENT catapults you into greatness. 
Talk about Ronaldo or Serana Williams and the many talents around us.
I keep screaming it, parents need to do more. Olamilekan may not be the most brilliant boy in his class. 
He may not even be going to a private school for all you know, but he has a mother who knows what greatness smells like and I tell you, greatness is not in wealth or in books but in the mental growth of everyone. 
The day we all realize that we need to first know the talent that God has given us and how to nurture it, that is the day we have stopped EXISTING and have started LIVING.
Olamilekan’s story can never remain the same again. 
He said: “I want to be like Michelangelo. and I was like ‘Tosin, how did he know this guy?’ 
Looking at his background, who told him the story of the great artist?
Who are the ones your kids want to be like? 
Who are the people your kids live up to? Who are they? What story are you relating to them? 
You think if his mother was telling him about Slay Queen, he will know Michelangelo? 
What are you saying around your kids?
And summer break is coming, some people are thinking of enrolling their kids in school again. 
Some are thinking otherwise.
What are you thinking? 
What on earth are you thinking?
I have said it million times, in 20 years, we are going to see the reward of our investments.

The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide
The Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to “make America great again,” as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War.
You probably know who I am talking about. 
The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. 
Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?
Not by a long shot. 
The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. 
Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.
You would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. 
In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.
