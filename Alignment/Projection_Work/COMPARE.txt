The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\nAdesanmi, born February 27, 1972, was author of the popular book Naija No Dey Carry Last, a 2015 collection of satirical essays.\nAdesanmi was a Fellow of the French Institute for Research in Africa from 1993 to 1997, and of the French Institute of South Africa in 1998 and 2000.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, he was Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the Pennsylvania State University, United States.\nBISHOP AMATU BURIES 96-YEAR-OLD MUM By Regina Igwebuike\nIn a welcome address, School Manager, Rev.

with partner agencies have announced 2020 first round of National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs) in the state.\nExecutive Secretary, ASPHCDA, Dr Chioma Ezenyimulu made the announcement during the State Social Mobilisation Committee (SSMC) meeting at ASPHCDA office complex, Awka.\nShe noted that the event which was always held between March and April in past years would now hold\nWe are confusing regulation with policy.\nThere was a determination on this USSD, even before the appointment of the Minister, he stated.\nIt is not about the good boy, but this is commercial and the normal things have been done.\nOperators did not come up overnight to charge four Naira.\nIt was robustly deliberated upon and a decision jointly taken before the legal instrument was published for implementation by all parties involved,” he explained further.\nSimilarly, the President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Olusola Teniola, vehemently queried where the autonomy of the NCC lies if the ministry continues to interfere.\nTeniola stated that the Federal Government needed to allow the NCC’s independence to enforce decisions made, especially as it bothers on the development of the telecommunications industry.\nIndeed, The Guardian checks showed that there is a legal basis for the NCC’s intervention to protect telecoms service consumers (i.e.bank customers who use USSD for financial transactions).\nEarlier in his keynote address on ``Reforming the Maritime Sector in Onitsha; Priority Areas, Potential Projects and the Way Forward,’’

issues resolved that they will continue working to complete the port project.\nMr Moghalu said this while exchanging views with newsmen after a sensitisation seminar of South East zone stakeholders by NIWA.\nNCC is also saddled with the responsibility of promoting fair competition in the communications industry and protection of services and facilities providers from misuse of market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by other service or facilities providers or equipment suppliers; and the responsibility to general responsibility of the Commission for economic and technical regulation of the communications industry.\nTo many Nigerians, the use of USSD sounded new, but checks by The Guardian showed that the initiative has been in effect since 2014.\nThis initiative, however, got a boost this year, when the NCC did a determination report on it.\nThe report obtained from NCC’s website termed ‘Determination of USSD Pricing,’ dated July 23, 2019, and signed by the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof.\nUmar Danbatta, revealed, among other things, that a USSD session is 20 seconds; the cost of a USSD session is N1.\n63K the price floor for a 20 seconds USSD service is N1.\n63k while price cap for a 20 Seconds USSD Session is N4.\nThe Determination document envisaged the implementation of the USSD charges by the mobile network operators (MNOs) to take effect from September 1, 2019, and remains valid and binding on
