NCC is also saddled with the responsibility of promoting fair competition in the communications industry and protection of services and facilities providers from misuse of market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by other service or facilities providers or equipment suppliers; and the responsibility to general responsibility of the Commission for economic and technical regulation of the communications industry. ||| NCC bụkwa ndị enyere ọrụ ịhụ maka ikwalite ezigbo asọmụmpi n'ụlọọrụ ịkpọ oku na nchekwa ozi na  ndị na-eweta akụrụngwa n'iwehie ike ahịa ma ọbụ ịgba mgba megide asọmụmpi na omume adịghị mma site n'aka ndị ozi ma ọbụ ndị mweta akụrụngwa, na ọrụ nke ọrụ gburugburu nke Kọmishọn maka akụnaụba na nchịkwa akụrụngwa nke ụlọọrụ nzisa ozi 'Commission for economic and technical regulation'
To many Nigerians, the use of USSD sounded new, but checks by The Guardian showed that the initiative has been in effect since 2014. ||| N'ebe ọtụtụ ndị Naịjirịa no, iji USSD bụụrụ ha ihe ọhụrụ, mana nnyocha sitere n'aka Guardian gosiri na amụma a dịrịị ire kamgbe afọ 2014.

The Determination document envisaged the implementation of the USSD charges by the mobile network operators (MNOs) to take effect from September 1, 2019, and remains valid and binding on licensees. ||| Akwụkwọ mkpebi ahụ tinyere mmalite nke nha USSD site n'aka ndị ọrụ netiwọk ekwentị 'mobile network operators' (MNOs) imalite n'ụbọchị mbụ nke ọnwa Sepụtemba n'afọ 2019 ma gaa n'ihu ịdị ire nye ndị enyere ikike ahụ.
However, Whether the MTN took official permission before its announcement to its customers remains unclear, as telecoms licensees are obligated to always get official approval/permission of the regulator before going to market to introduce any new tariff or pricing regime to their subscribers. ||| Etu ọ dị, ma ndị MTN anatara ikike n'ụzọ ziri ezi tutu ha maa ọkwa nye ndị ahịa edobeghị anya, ka ndị ọrụ akpọm oku kwesiri ịnata ikike ziri ezi site n'aka ndị nlekọta tutu ha abanye ahịa tinye ụgwọ ọhụrụ nye ndị ahịa ha.
The legal document also notes that “the Commission reserves the right to amend and review this Determination at any time, as well as to consider other options to incentivise the communications industry,” and not the ministry. ||| akwụkwọ iwu ahụ kwukwara na kọmịshọn nwere ikike imenwo ma megharịa Mkpebi ahụ oge ọbụla, ma lelekwaa ohere ndị ọzọ iji wulie ụlọ ọrụ akpọm oku, ma ọbụghị ụlọ ozi.

In the formulation of this Determination, it was gathered that the banks had applied to the NCC for USSD codes for their mobile transactions, where they were now directed to the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) independently. ||| na mmebe Mkpebi nke a, emere ka a mata na ụlọakụ edeela akwụkwọ gara ndị NCC maka akara USSD nke eji akwụ ụgwọ site n'ekwentị, ebe enyere ha ikike ugbua nyere Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) nke nọọrọ onwe ya.
Meanwhile, ALTON’s accounts of how the USSD usage by the banks began and the support of the Commission in allowing the banks to use the USSD platform to facilitate digital financial inclusion is also revealing in the document obtained by The Guardian. ||| Etu ọ dị, akaụntụ ALTON etu esi eji USSD site n'aka ndị ụlọakụ malitere na nkwado nke kọmịshọn n'inye ndị ụlọakụ ikike iji USSD wee kwalite ntinye ego dijital na-egosi n'akwụkwọ nke Guardian nwetara.
According to ALTON, while telecommunication services and infrastructure became more accessible in the country, the banks identified the USSD channel as a cost-efficient way of delivering financial services to their customers. ||| Site n'aka ALTON, ebe ozi ọkpụkpọ oku ekwentị na arụrarụ bụ na-eruzi aka n'ala a, ndị ụlọakụ gosipụtara ọwara USSD dịka ụzọ dị ọnụ ala eji ezije ozi ego nye ndị ahịa ha.

The body also said the banks also used this channel to grow significant revenues running into billions of Naira in view of the large disparity between the cost charged by its members and the charge imposed by the banks on their customers. ||| Ụlọ ọrụ kwukwara na ụlọakụ na-esi n'ụzọ dị etua enweta akatamkpo ego ruru ijeri naịra na ndị n'etiti ego ndị otu ya na-ana na ego ndị ụlọakụ na-ana ndị ahịa ha
For instance, data from the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) showed that between January and March 2019, USSD-based transactions conducted through mobile money by some 2.3 million customers averaged 41.1 million valued at N810 billion worth of transactions. ||| ọmụmaatụ, data si na Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) gosiri na site n'ọnwa Jenụwarị rue Maachị afọ 2019, azụmahịa nke gbadoro ụkwụ na USSD emere site ego ekwentị n'aka ndị ahịa nde 2.3 opekata mpe nde 41.1 nke nyere azụmahịa ijeri narị naịra asatọ na iri. 
Onitsha, Feb. 25, 2020 (MOI) Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Mr George Moghalu, says he will strive to make the Onitsha River Port functional during his tenure. ||| Ọnịcha, abalị iri abụọ na ise nke ọnwa Febụwarị n'afọ 2020 (MOI) Onye Nlekọta, Onyeisi Kpatakpata 'Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Maazị George Moghalu, kwuru na ọ ga-agba mbọ hụ na Ọdụ ụgbọ Mmiri nke Ọnịcha malitere rụwa ọrụ n'ọchịchị ya.

ALTON noted that these new services continued to place a strain on its members’ network resources, which resulted in their continued and further investments to ensure that the SDCCH channel was dimensioned to handle the increased traffic as a result of the new banking services being deployed on it. ||| ALTON kwupụtara na ozi ọhụrụ ndịa na-etinye nhịam ahụ na ihe nnweta netịwọk ndị ọrụ ya, nke mere ka ha na-etinye ego gaa n'ihu iji hụ na ọwara SDCCH bụ nke emebere ka ọ jide nrigo nke trafiik nke ntinye n'ije ozi ọhụrụ ụlọakụ kpatara

However, since the suspension of the USSD charges by the Ministers, no authority has stopped the banks from charging customers an amount ranging from N10- N50, according to ALTON and confirmation by sources within the banking industry. ||| etu ọ dị, kamgbe a kwụsịrị ụgwọ ọrụ nke USSD site n'aka Mịnịsta, enwebeghị ikike kwụsịrị ndị ụlọakụ ịna ndị ahịa ha ego ọrụ site na naịra iri rue naịra iri ise, site na ALTON na nkwupụta nke si n'aka ndị nọ n'ọrụ ụlọakụ

Earlier reports that a cargo door blew out are not entirely unfounded. ||| mkpesa nke gboo kwuru na ụzọ ebe ibu dị fepụrụ abụghị eziokwu

Of the incident, Boeing spokesperson, Paul Bergmanm, explained that in the final load testing of the 777X static test airplane, the team conducted a test that involves bending the wings of the airplane up to a level far beyond anything expected in commercial service. ||| n'ihe mberede ahụ, onye na-ekwuchitere ndị Boeing, Paul Bergmanm, kọwara na nnyocha mbunye nke ikpeazụ nke nnyocha otu ebe nke ụgbọelu 777X, ndị otu ọrụ ahụ mere nnyocha nke gunyere ịrọji nku ụgbọelu ahụ rue n'ogogo karịrị ihe ọbụla atụrụ anya n'azụmahịa ozi

Most people wrongly associate gender issues with women’s issues. ||| imirikiti mmadụ na-ewehie okwu banyere mbụrụ nyere okwu nwaanyị
I recall doing a degree in Gender Studies and when people asked what I was studying and I replied gender, they would nevertheless proceed to ask, “So, what is women’s studies about?”. ||| echetara m ịgụ akwụkwọ n'ihe gbasara Okike ma mgbe ndị mmadụ jụrụ m ihe m na-agụ, m zaa ha Okike, ha ga-aga n'ihu ịjụ, "Ya mere, gịnị bụ isi agụmaakwụkwọ ụmụ nwaanyị a?"
It was baffling. ||| ọ nyeghị ọnụ okwu

Instead, I chose to study gender because I am interested in masculinity and femininity, in gender norms attributed to the male and female sexes, in the interaction – the never-ending conflicts and also the opportunities to live together harmoniously – caused by gender roles. ||| kama, ahọọrọ m ịgụ okike n'ihi na enwere m mmasị n'ihe banyere oke na nne, ụdị okike nke enyere nwoke na nwaanyị, na mkparịtaụka-agha anaghị ebi ebi na ohere ibikọrịta n'udo-nke ọrụ okike na-ebute.
What are those roles? The answer depends on many things, including the particular environment that you find yourself in. ||| Gịnị bụ ọrụ ndịa? azịza ya danyere n'ọtụtụ ihe, nke gunyere na gburugburu ebe ị hụrụ onwe gị
In a country like Nigeria, gender roles not only vary from region to region but they’re also shaped by our tetchy colonial past, and the education and religion that came with that predicament. ||| na mba dịka Naịjirịa, ọrụ okike abụghị naanị na ọ nwere ndịịiche site n'mpaghara rue mpaghara ma ha bụ nke ndị dọọrọ anyị n'agha tinyere n'ime anyị, ma agụmaakwụkwọ na okpukpe, ha ji ihe ihujuanya ahụ bịa
Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world where, for example, women have reigned not only as queens but as kings. ||| Naịjirịa bụ n'ime mba olenaole n'ụwa ebe, ọmụmaatụ, ụmụ nwaanyị achịala ọ bụghị naanị dịka eze nwaanyị ma dịka eze 
In fact, female kings such as Ahebi Ugbabe who ruled Igala in Igboland in the twentieth century are arguably a precursor to transgender (people who express their gender outside of the norm) discussions today. ||| Etu ọ dị, ndị eze nke nwaanyị dịka Ahebi Ugbabe nke chịrị Igala n'ala Igbo na senchịrị iri abụọ bụ ana agbagha na ọ bụ nwaanyị ghọọrọ nwoke (mmadụ ndị jiiri mbụrụ gafee etu e siri dote ya) mkparịtaụka nke ụbọchị taa
However, Nigeria is also a country where, to give another example, if you are male you can pass your nationality to a non-Nigerian female through marriage. ||| etu ọ dị, Naịjirịa bụkwa ala ebe, inye ọmụmaatụ ọzọ, ọ bụrụ na ị bụ nwoke, ị ga-aghọ onye mba ọzọ site n'alụmdi
If on the other hand you are a Nigerian female, by all means set your eyes on a non-Nigerian husband, but our legislation will always consider your marriage as one to a foreigner. ||| ọ bụrụ na n'aka nke ọzọ n'ịbụ nwaanyị Naịjirịa, ma na-ele anya di abụghị onye Naịjirịa, iwu anyị ga-ewe alụmdi gị dịka nke ndị ọbịa.

men should never be vulnerable and women should never be bossy yada yada yada) since most powerful traits are seen to be masculine, if you are a woman there is perhaps even more of an incentive to define womanhood for yourself. ||| nwoke agaghị ada mba ma nwaanyị agaghị abụ onyeisi ebe ihe banyere ike bụ nke atụnyeere nwoke, ọ bụrụ na ịbụ nwaanyị enwere ihe ndị ọzọ aga eji kọwaa ịbụ nwaanyị nyere gị
