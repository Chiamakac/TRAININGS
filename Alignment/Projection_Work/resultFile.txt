{"text":"I understand if the salary, three flat rooms and SUV are enough for you and as a result, cause a lack of purpose for the land where you were born\nI too have a passion for Nigeria and include other citizens like Omoyele Sowore, who have experienced despair and abandonment\nSeeking a revolt without a gun or going to overthrow a government is not and will not be illegal\nIt is not a crime to stand up for one's conscience by seeking change\nIt is this that has led to democracy as a system of government which is defined as \"government of the people, by the people and given to the people\".\nIf protesting and calling #Regurrence is now illegal, the courts should convict Omoyele Sowore of holding him for more than 120 days\nSo, knowing that your silence or your involvement in civil society in the face of opposition, crime and social ills does not make you a good person\nYou have no vision and you are only self-aware\nYou see, I am writing this post because someone told me to shut up on Sowore talk and focus on my business on whatsapp, and I laughed\nHe is going to read this article, so I will not mention his name where the viewer does not agree with my beliefs.\nFor you, the reader, know that the purpose of this statement when you are told \"your mind is on your business\" is not just to sell your product\nIt is also about showing interest in your country and speaking out against the violations and violations of social norms, minorities, and minorities.\nIf your country is a banana republic where people are being tried in the middle of the day, what will happen to your business and your intention to trade with international producers?\nEvery business knows what they are doing, complaining every year at the end of every year including a focus on technology, politics, social and economic environment.\nThis skill of environmental research, which is important to write such a complaint is the responsibility of the Public Relations Practioner, who has the intelligence, skills and character to conduct research and development in the community and make complaints to the management and team leaders or master it serves for good planning\nYes, this helps to organize and coordinate with business executives about the potential benefits of the business environment as well as the potential risks for a successful business.\nIt is not as expensive to work as you are in the blood from the development of the environment in which you live and live\nFor example, with the deteriorating health care system in our country today, if a person is involved in a minor accident or becomes ill with a medical condition that is minor or neglected where there is good health care, such a thing can lead to the death of the person\nAs criminal law has become a tradition in 1984, let me be clear that a good foreign businessman would be afraid to do business in Nigeria knowing that he is a good citizen who is respected and a good leader like Omoyele Sowore. is a person who will go to court, anything that will happen to him including his business\nIf you put this in many cases of fraud, bribery, bankruptcy and the lack of public resources, how do you think the wealthy Monaco, who saw a real business opportunity in Nigeria would still be looking for\nso, when you think you are silent is a long speech, I do not agree\nhow exactly it is a matter of length or silence in the face of injustice\nOne of the most dangerous things for any business that violates the law and the rule of law, fairness and the right to a hearing\nBusinesses thrive by complying with the law and having a fair and public justice system without fear or favor\nto dispel any doubts, here are a few of the other things any man or woman who wants to trade land is not where he was born:\n1. Political, personal and economic blessings\n2. Skill work\n3. tax money\n4. Travel and efficiency\n5. Their wealth and glory\nwithout respect given the second and fourth marks, let me be clear that no trader will leave his land for profit if the other elements of this text are in the first place. this article does not exist\nThe first article in the series addresses the opposition to Omoyele Sowore and his supporters and sends a message of legal disregard and impartiality.\nSo, I think the government should look at this issue and think about us as customers, who are trying to have a relationship with other big companies and a better way to get wealth and provide services to more than
