Do you want to 'flee' to Canada?
here are six things you need to know about the overseas:
Prepare for your accommodation before leaving
Apart from the flight ticket, before going, plan on where you will stay when you reach overseas.
it is in your brother's house, your friend or in a hotel.
If you have anyone in mind, make sure the person is willing to accommodate you, so that you won't be stranded in the airport.
so that you won't be disappointed when you couldn't reach the person when you get there.
there are many hotels with different price tags depending on the amount you have.
if you have a short stay, you would rather stay in 'Airbnb' than hotels.
this will also allow you to prepare your own diet.
You can find from the internet the type as well as the locations you need.
be prepared for the prevention of extreme cold
Sweaters, hats and scarves are among the things someone who wants to travel to the overseas during the winter needs to go with
Currently, Britain, America and the rest countries in abroad are in winter.
For example, London is in nine degree, while New York is in four degree.
Before you leave Nigeria, it is important that you buy sweaters for coverage because the weather over there is not favorable.
Anne Ifedigbo, who lives in the United States, explains, You need to be prepared with clothes, cap, scarf, shoes, and trousers.'
get ready for unexpected sickness 
try and buy medicines for headaches, cough, diarrhea, and taifod fever before traveling. 
Sickness does not announce its coming, especially when traveling.
Try and purchase some drugs for headaches, coughs, diarrhea, malaria and balm to be ready for prevention.
Getting a little medication in the overseas may not be easy for you if you need it.
Buy traveling permit 
If you arrive in the overseas, buy a traveling document called 'Oyster card' and put money in it.
which will make it easier for you to move around.
you will use Oyster cards to pay for cars or trucks.
know that cars are cheaper than trucks.
Again is that the driver will give you the opportunity to be looking around while you're traveling.
remember to visit a tourist spot
The tourists queue to enter St Paul's Cathedral Church in London where Diana and Charles were married several years ago
If you are done with the main thing you went to do, remember to visit places and look around.
there are many tourist attractions that you would like to see if visit the overseas.

if it is in London, Thames River, New York ; Liberty Statue,
places like St Paul's Cathedral where Adaeze Diana and Charles
you want to buy something, go to these places
If you travel abroad, you might like to buy a few things for yourself and your family.
Items such as clothes, shoes, jewelries, necklaces and other items.
In Britain, Central London is a popular place known for fashion designing as Tom Hilger, Tezeni, a plaza.
Woolrich in London is also one of the places where you can get things at affordable prices.
While Depford is where you can find already used items at cheaper rate.
what you should use, which should not
The main thing when traveling to the overseas is to get real visa and not fake papers .
Things you should not go with include: drugs, guns or ammunition, certain foods and any liquid item.
In some countries, you will not be allowed to enter the plane with things like liquid foods, perfume.
be careful as friends or relatives give you something to sent to someone living abroad so that you will not be involved in any problems.

Igbo Taboos: five things that Igbo land forbids
Five things that can cause death in the olden days in Igbo land, for the land forbids it
This family killed
Till now, murder is an abomination in the entire Igbo land
In the olden days, the Igbos have many behaviours which attract death immediately someone commits them
Chiagozie Nnabuihe who is a professor of African studies in the University of Lagos, explained that it is the spirit underworld that forbids these abomination
who is the spirit of the land?
Tradition explained that the spirit of the land is a woman
do you know the god worshipped by the Igbos in the olden days?
can you do the kind of sacrifices of appeal done in the olden days
Aside Most-high God, land is the most important spirit in Igbo land
In the olden days, Igbo believes that land can trouble anyone that defiles it
it is this spirit that ensure the germination of seed in the farm, and also continous wetness of the ground
What are the five things the Igbos and Spirit of the land forbid?
murder
Anyone that commits murder will bear the consequences
The land forbids human blood
Nnabuihe explained that the Igbos believed that land is a life giver
That is why it becomes law that nobody kills another, for the person will not be able to give life
The punishment for anybody who commits murder is to banish the person from the land or send the person to the evil forest where he/she will die
to commit suicide
The land will reject who kills himself
Like murder, suicide is also what the land forbids because blood is involved
Nnabuihe explained that the land rejects the corpse of anyone that commits suicide
Before they take the person's corpse to the evil forest, the native doctors will offer many sacrifices to wipe out any disaster which it could bring to the people
it is after this ceremony that the youths will carry the person's corpse to the evil forest
sleeping with a member of your family
this is what the land forbids and also an abomination in Igbo land
If a child is born through this act, the villagers will carry him to the evil forest and banish the family of the child from the land
Igbo believes that land has cursed that family
sleeping with animals
This animal contacts disease
It is difficult to hear that someone commits such a thing in Igbo land
But whenever it happens, Igbo believes that the land will transmit disease to the person
This disease could be madness, leprosy, stomach upset or dropsy and other things
The people will hurriedly take the person to the evil forest where he will die
giving birth to twins
Christianity has made Igbos stopped many of these laws
This is heartbreaking but the cause is not known
Igbo believes in the olden days that the land is a life giving spirit, also gives child, gives a couple only one baby at a time
The believe that any woman who give birth to twins, has a sexual affair with another man who is not her husband
What happens when a woman gives birth to twins is that both the woman and the children will be taken to the evil forest where they will die

Fuel subsidy: it is better for us that it is removed- Chizea
A professor of economics Boniface Chizea explained that there is gain in the removal of the money for fuel subsidy 
Fuel dispenser
A professor of economics Boniface Chizea explained the gain of removal of the money for fuel subsidy is bigger than the loss in it
The fuel dealers in Anambra state have called off strike
We Nigerians have suffered greatly
Remember that the leader of the International Monetary Fund named Christine Lagarde has called upon federal government to remove the money for fuel subsidy
Immediately he said this, fuel scarcity started in many civilised cities as people began to buy fuel concurrently for the fear of scarcity
But in his discussion with Igbo BBC, Chizea explained that the removal of the fuel subsidy will cause inflation but if it is left, things will become better as goverment will be able to save fund that would have been wasted in paying for subsidy
put it to work
people do not understand: it will cause a little inflation
The people that get rich through it are much: the middlemen, who steal our oil to other countries are those whom the subsidy favour
Chizea a one time banker said that it is the current level of the government increased the price of fuel supposed for them to excempt addition to the fuel price
In his explanation, the loss in it includes;
Fuel subsidy caused the money that should be given to the producers of goods, to import working equiqments which is giving to fuel importers
Government borrows money to pay for subsidy, he said that if nothing is done about it, Nigeria will go back to her former condition before Ngozi Okonjo-Iwela got pardon on the borrowed money

Drug abuse: taking preventive drugs unnecessarily reduces its effectiveness
A medical doctor has stated why preventive drugs are not effective anymore
Drugs
WHO has stated that many 'antibiotics' are no more effective as supposed now
In the discussion between the Igbo BBC and a medical personnel Doctor Orhiakhi, he stated many things why the drugs are not effective anymore
Government has banned codeine
Codeine: NAFDAC has shutdown 3 pharmaceutical industry
See the things he said
These bacteria will persist that the drug will not be effective
If the patient does not take the drug as dued, through overdose or over taking the prescribed days
Some take these preventive drugs when not supposed which could affect the effectiveness of the drug in the future
Not taken up to the right prescribed doses can cause the uneffectiveness of the drugs
These cause the drugs to be familiar with the bacteria, thereby causing the uneffectiveness of the drugs
But who really are they? Simply, technology.
Kano is centre of commerce, but if Kano does not become centre of e-commerce, it will disappear because technology is the future.
Everything is electronic now, even in Nigeria right now, any company that is not leveraging on technology will die.
If Shoprite does not evolve to online sales, Jumia will kill them and that's the truth.
So, that's the future, there is nothing you can do about it.
How does your New Partner Programme works?.
It is very simple, normally if I refer you to a broker, there is what we call spread, which is the difference between buying and selling price.
That is where brokers make their money.
They share about 50 per cent of that trading initially and we call them partners.
What if I refer you and you now become a partner and you refer somebody else and that person becomes a partner, who also referred someone?
Shouldn't you be making money in referring somebody?
That is the new system that we have created, like higher level of stream of income for a partner, making it a multi-layer, instead of just a single layer system.
How reliable is the technology behind this business plan?.
Technology is not new.
At least, I have been in the business between seven and eight years and it has been around that same time.
I don't think there has ever been any day that the whole market is down and nothing is working.
That has never happened.
For example, about 60 per cent of the whole American economy is in New York Stock Exchange, which is why companies like Ali Baba in China can leave the country to raise money in America because there's no other place you can get that kind of money.
The whole American economy is built on the New York Stock Exchange, which is the same trading we are talking about.
If it is not reliable, they won't put all their lives in it.
When people tell me that the likes of 'Wonder Banks' and MMM had gone under, wondering if the forex market will not go like them, I only tell them that they are looking at it locally.
Forex market is not a Nigerian thing, it's not an American thing, it is not a Japanese thing, it is the whole world and driven by a level of fundamentals.
So, it can go down unless human beings are all going down.
What competitive advantage is Rally Trade coming with?.
To be frank, all brokers offer the same thing.
It's like all Nigerian stockbrokers offer the same thing.
You want to buy First Bank or GTBank shares, they are all offering the same thing.
But the things that can make you different are in-depth customer service, things that sometimes, as a stockbroker, you take more time to research on.
Of course, you can advise your clients on how to buy shares.
But if people can see that your clients are making more money, it becomes extra advantage.
In Rally Trade for instance, we have unusual customer support.
Our staff call clients every day to know if there is any problem or challenge.
Every client has a dedicated staff that takes care of his or her business.
Then we have the best education system here.
There is no company that is educating Nigerians like Rally academy does.
In terms of our conferences, expos, seminars and the trainings we do in our office frequently.
So, those are some of the two major advantages that we have- essential customer service and quality education system.
There is this fear about Fintech, especially that of trust.
What is your take?.
All a company can do is to make sure that it is dealing with a regulated institution, the same way we are sure that banks are regulated by Central Bank of Nigeria.
We are regulated in Europe by financial commission.
At the same time, when I talk to people about online business, if you decide to run away and hide yourself in the sand, saying you don't trust it, your money might disappear, you will never do anything.
You won't believe that some people don't use ATM till today, you know why, saying if they are being caught up in a corner, all their money will be collected.
Some people don't use Internet banking but that doesn't help you at all.
You are losing more than you are gaining.
That is the way it is.
With the current technology comes challenges and hacking of funds, but yet, there is nothing you can do about it other than find how to use them safely and make sure you do enough research.
Wherever you are putting your money, do extensive research.
For instance, in the last 10 years, Nigerians have gone through several scams.
We had MMM, Wonder Banks, among others, but I have never lost one kobo to any of them because I learnt about 10 years ago that there are no free money and I had been a victim online, when I lost like $200 and had to withdraw.
So, when Wonder Bank and MMM came, I knew that it was just scam.
People need to be educated, do research, then you really have very little issues when it comes to doing financial business online.
What is the MT4 Platform all about?.
Let me try to describe the MT4 in a simple way.
Let's use car, which is the best way.
A Toyota and a Honda, what is the difference? Nothing! They both are cars.
But in Nigeria, we have more Toyota than Honda, why? People just love Toyota! Or maybe Toyota is easier to maintain or it has more second hand value or it is cheaper to buy.
The same way we have different trading platforms.
For instance, there is a company called Tesla, which makes car in the U.S.
He added that immense opportunities abound in the sector that had remained largely untapped. 'This is why most advanced economies of the world have highly developed their maritime industries'.
They didn't exist before now.
The same way companies create trading platforms for themselves.
So, I can start a brokerage company and decide that like the software banks use, I don't want to use a certain platform, but a fresh one people can trade on that can be better, but that doesn't mean people are going to love it.
Tesla is in America now but doesn't mean it is selling more than Toyota that has been selling for a while.
MT4 is just a platform people trade on, just to buy and sell, that is what it is but it is the oldest, it has the highest adoption, it is what people love the most, so every broker has it.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
It does not bother me at all that you woke up today and you are bothered by matters bothering your brethren, male and female.
It does not bother me at all that you are there seated or standing running after the necessities of life.
It bothers me a trifle that you are buffeted by the vicissitudes of life, by the vagaries and uncertainties of living and by the pursuit of that which would not last.
Quran used for muslim prayer.
Yes.
It is the will of the Almighty in creation that all subjects born of the womb shall toil and labour in order to enjoy and suffer.
The worshipper of the Merciful shall observe vigil at night in order to qualify for His favours.
The armed robber shall forsake the pleasure of his bed at night in order to visit pain on the neighbourhood and thereby qualify for punishment and eternal damnation.
Yes.
Those who shall enter paradise have to work and sweat; those who shall enter hell would have to earn it through toil and labour! I am not bothered by all of these simply because this is the reality.
I am concerned with one other thing, however.
I am concerned with the possibility that you are involved in the frenetic pursuit of this world on the assumption that you could indeed have it all.
No! You cannot have it all.
Nobody has ever had it all.
Nobody will ever have it all.
Evidence in support of these claims and assertions are there in your wakeful moments, in your everyday life.
There she is seated.
The pepper grinder in the neighbourhood.
Every time her husband copulates with her, pregnancy sets in.
Today, she is nursing two beautiful girls.
Only a year before, she gave birth to a boy.
Her husband is the Chief Messenger in that office.
Yes.
The Chief Messenger.
To every profession its chief.
There is the Chief Whip in the Parliament.
There are chiefs in the palace.
I wonder whether there are chiefs among thieves and kidnappers.
Yes.
There are Chief Lecturers.
But there are no Chief Professors.
Now the chief messenger of interest to me today is he whose spermatozoic prowess is reminiscent of the 'Danfo' driver in the other part of the town.
The latter is loved and abhorred by women in the bus station by equal measure.
They know that whenever he 'touches' the opposite sex, often times illicitly, the latter would bear the 'burden' for the next nine months.
This Chief Danfo driver owns no vehicle.
He owns no properties.
He has no investment in any blue-chip companies.
He has no bank accounts.
He knows that he is poor.
He desires to be rich.
But at least for now, he is contented in the knowledge that he does not have it all.
He is contented that at least he has his virility and masculinity.
He is happy in the knowledge that he is an active partaker in the unceasing task of populating the world!.
Across the town, in an area known as GRA, there lives the multi-millionaire.
He has almost everything money can buy- a posh house and state-of-the-art automobiles.
His wife is that woman who is subject of the second gaze whenever she steps out of her home: beautiful, elegant and intelligent.
However, despite these provisions and blessings, the woman is not happy.
She cries every night because she has not been blessed with the fruit of the womb.
Whenever she contemplates the plum and pleasure that surrounds her, she remembers what material comfort cannot provide.
She shed hot tears for being barren.
She has it; but she cannot have it all.
Meanwhile, one of the children of the poor 'Danfo' driver is registered in one of the public schools in the neighbourhood.
As fate would have it, he is a classmate to one of the children of the 'big men' in town.
While the child of the poor driver comes to school barefooted and in completely worn out school uniform, his classmate is brought to school every morning by a chauffeur-driven car.
The boy's food basket is usually the most sought after one during the break time.
The irony however is this- each time the school closes for the session, the son of the poor driver always takes the first position while his classmate, the child of the rich man, takes the last position.
The rich man has it; but he cannot, by His design, have it all.
Have you ever found yourself in situations where people demand favours from you, favours you cannot grant unto yourself?
What about the Vice-Chancellor of that university whose children have continually failed the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) organized by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
He presides over life-long opportunities; opportunities none of his children can by law enjoy.
He has this; he does not have that because he cannot have it all!.

'We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,' Moghalu said.

There's a lot of talk about toilets lately.
After the Obama administration told US schools to let transgender pupils use toilets matching their gender identity, everyone has an opinion about who should use which toilet.
Meanwhile in the interest of public service, I'd also like to encourage a debate about 'how' toilets are used.
I encourage male readers to pay particular attention because I'm asking you to stop peeing on rather than in the toilet.
Were an alien species to conduct an in-depth study of the human species, they would say of Nigerian men – a well-adapted group, intellectually vigorous, entrepreneurial and charming, but with disgraceful toilet manners.
Of course there would be exceptions and some women would be similarly judged.
But the good number of male 'splashers' amidst us would bring the score down.
Since aliens may not land on earth in my lifetime, I conducted my own in-depth study about this corrosive issue.
The study did not (thankfully) involve visits to the Gents.
Rather it was undertaken (reluctantly) in the one given place where all genders share toilets, namely on airplanes.
The study confirmed that using the shared toilets on flights to and from Nigeria is an extraordinarily unpleasant experience.
In fact, the situation is such that on my next Nigeria bound flight I will bring a raincoat, rubber gloves and Wellies.
Jokes aside, toilet use is in truth a political issue.
Fela Anikulapo-Kuti himself often connected the scatological with the political.
Though judging by the lines, 'Long time ago African man no dey carry shit, we dey shit inside big big hole, na European man teach us to carry shit', Fela may have disagreed with me on toilet matters.
Because in a sense, I am indeed advocating for western toilet habits.
(By the way, I never imagined I would combine those last three words.).
Moghalu, then, said that developing a policy framework to include strategic objectives, policy action and strategic plan for implementation to precede reforming the transport sector.
To be clear, had we modernized the old African way of using the toilet to contemporary society it would be better suited both for the environment and for our bodies.
But I'm thankful that at least airplanes don't use the hole system, or I would need to add a diving suit to my in-flight gear.
Toilet use is not only a political matter, but also a 'geopolitical' one.
I hate to admit it, but I find myself making toilet habit comparisons between countries.
It turns out that flights to and from the US are a particularly 'dry' experience.
When you enter a toilet cubicle that has just been used by an American man, nine out of ten times it will be pristine.
Maybe American men go to a special toilet training school? Or maybe they are just particularly good at tactical target aiming.
[Sarcasm].
Whatever the case may be, I see no reason why my countrymen can't show equal consideration to their fellow human beings.
Tottenham Hotspur's South Korean striker Son Heung-Min (L) and Tottenham Hotspur's Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld (R) celebrate on the pitch after the English Premier League football match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at the Molineux stadium in Wolverhampton, central England on December 15, 2019.
Tottenham won the game 2-1. Paul ELLIS / AFP.
'It is on this basis that we have decided to engage the civil society and all other stakeholders in the maritime subsector in the South East Geopolitical Zone.
Jan Vertonghen's stoppage time header continued Tottenham's turnaround under Jose Mourinho as Spurs moved up to fifth with a 2-1 win at Wolves.
Mourinho's men were largely outplayed at Molineux, but were ruthless with their chances to inflict Wolves' first league defeat in 12 games.
Adama Traore's spectacular strike had cancelled out Lucas Moura's early opener before Vertonghen stooped to guide home Christan Eriksen's corner.
Spurs can now move into the top four before Christmas if they beat Chelsea at home next weekend.
That speaks volumes for the impact Mourinho has made in less than a month in charge as Tottenham trailed Chelsea and the top four by 12 points when he was appointed.
Wolves drop to eighth as their longest unbeaten run in the top flight since 1962 came to an end, but there was little more Nuno Espirito Santo's men could have done to at least avoid defeat.
After an industrious start by Wolves, it was Spurs who scored after eight minutes.
Son Heung-min's drive was beaten away by Rui Patricio but the ball was worked to Moura, who glided into the area before rifling in high from an angle for his third goal in seven games under Mourinho.
Wolves remained undaunted though and after Paulo Gazzaniga gathered Traore's low effort they began to create openings.
Diogo Jota was a menace and it was from his work Raul Jimenez nearly levelled after 26 minutes but his low effort flashed wide.
Soon after Jota was denied by the recovering Davinson Sanchez after the defender's initial mistake allowed the forward through.
Wolves continued to dominate but should have been 2-0 down nine minutes before the break.
Referee Stuart Attwell played a good advantage after Moura was fouled to allow Eric Dier forward.
He played a cute one-two with Dele Alli to leave the midfielder with just Patricio to beat but his low strike hit the post.
It would have been harsh on Wolves and they continued to push after the break.
Jota failed to turn in Traore's cross and Gazzaniga pushed away Jimenez's shot.
Spurs' defence had lived dangerously, with Vertonghen in particular struggling against the pace of Traore.
Wolves finally got their reward on 67 minutes.
Traore had given the visitors problems all game and he made them pay, collecting Jimenez's pass and unleashing a rocket which flew past Gazzaniga from 20 yards.
Tottenham then never looked like restoring their lead before the late drama.
Wolves remained the aggressors and Romain Saiss' glancing header four minutes later forced Gazzaniga into a fine stop.
But Spurs silenced the hosts in the first minute of injury time when Vertonghen nodded in Eriksen's corner.
Manish Rohtagi is the Business Head for Simba Group of Companies.
Simba Group has reiterated its commitment to empowering more Nigerians through its products and services.
Business Head of Simba TVS, Mr Manish Rohtagi, speaks on partnership with some Microfinance Banks, while banks should lend more to customers, the business environment, economy and challenges faced by businesses operating in the country.
What is Simba Group all about?.
Simba Group has been in this country for over 30 years.
We started our business with bicycles and bicycle parts way back in 1988.
We are present in several key sectors that are critical to the development of the Nigerian economy including transport, power, IT, agriculture etc.
The office you are in is the headquarters of our transport business.
We in partnership with TVS Motors India are the largest manufacturers of kekes (tricycles) in Nigeria and our two wheelers, also known colloquially as okadas, continue to reshape the Nigerian two-wheeler market.
How does the TVS brand help the Nigerian Economy?.
Transport is essential to the functioning of any economy and is one of the main drivers of it.
Our products address the last mile transport needs of Nigerians.
It has been shown each tricycle or motorcycle sold creates employment for around four people as these machines not only require riders, but also mechanics, dealers and spares distributors etc.
That's even without considering our own employees.
Hence this industry is one of the biggest employment generators in the country.
Along with that we have been running several programmes that empower the youth of the country.
We have worked with several government agencies including National Automotive Design Development Council (NADDAC), National Directorate of Employment (NDE) among others and trained countless people into becoming keke riders or mechanics for free.
We also try to partner with the State and Federal Governments so that we empower more and more youths.
Could you tell us a bit about Simba Group's other companies?.
As I mentioned earlier, along with transportation, Simba Group is into power backup.
Our Luminous Inverters are the most popular inverter brand in the country, we are also heavily investing in the development of solar energy.
Other companies in the group include Simba Agric where we focus on mechanisation which includes tractors and irrigation systems – both responsible for increasing agricultural productivity.
Simba Cycles sells bicycles, SimbaNET provides business connectivity solutions to corporates and Simba Infrastructure offers Business Communication Solutions in partnership with Avaya.
But basically, the focus area for me is transportation.
What have been the challenges so far?.
We get lots of support from government institutions but there is still a huge opportunity for public and private sector financial institutions to increase the access to cheap and collateral-free borrowing, in order to provide a major boost to the industry, and the economy at large.
How many financial institutions have helped?.
There has been much progress, and impetus from the Central Bank as well.
But there's still a long way to go before we really begin to see efficient financial models coming into play.
There are few microfinance banks who have partnered with us and things are getting better.
If many more banks can come and offer people loans to buys kekes and okadas at a subsidised rate or even collateral free, then things will move much faster.
What are your projections for the nearest future?.
We see limitless growth potential in the country and the growth quantum can be much bigger than any other countries.
Nigeria can be among the top 10 economies in the world.
I truly believe that, and our investments in the economy certainly reflect that.
Is your organisation into any Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities?.
CSR has always been integral to the Simba Group.
As part of our group philosophy of empowerment, even our CSR programmes follow the same ideology.
At the heart of our offering is our emphasis on training- something that we provide free of charge to mechanics and engineers who aspire to be mini-entrepreneurs or gainfully employed in the industries we represent.
We have intervened in times of national disaster, such as our actions and contributions during the recent Kano floods, and have been praised for our contributions to the victims of that terrible atrocity.
We believe in wome empowerment very strongly, and our efforts to support the development of women, have taken two forms.
Firstly, we have partnered with the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD) to distribute cycles to girl students to encourage them to attend school.
And secondly, we run the Queen Riders programme – a programme in which we train and certify women from under-privileged backgrounds to become Keke riders and help them on the path to self-employment by harnessing the ecosystem of financiers that we have created.
Celebrating its 125 years of research and impacts, the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, has acknowledged the positive impacts of a homegrown technological device developed in Nigeria on value chain development of the root and tuber crops in Africa.
The institute admits that smallholder farmers have benefited and would continue to improve their means of livelihood with the use of value-adding devices in the post-harvest management of their roots and tubers.
The device, called flash dryer, dries agricultural products such as yam, cassava, potato and other granulated food commodities for elongated shelf life, higher profitability and food security.
The project that propped up the improvement of the design by Nobex Technologies was an initiative of Cassava: Adding Value for Africa (CAVA), facilitated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and executed through multiple partnership.
One of the ways CAVA2 supports smallholders is by offering farmers more 'avenues for sales' for their cassava roots.
To ensure a smooth flow of roots from farm to product, CAVA2 works with SMEs to expand and develop processing capacity; a key issue is the availability of quality equipment and after sales service.
The Nigerian who developed the device in working with the institute, Mr Idowu Adeoya, fabricates equipment for drying and roasting root and tuber crops.
The improvement to the flash dryer, which dries agricultural products almost instantaneously, was started in 2006 when the fabricator was first contacted by specialists from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), led by the Country Manager of CAVA Nigeria, Professor Lateef Sanni, and a food processing specialist from NRI, Dr Andrew Graffham, from the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, the United Kingdom.
As part of a FUNAAB-NRI collaboration, they had encountered a Nobex flash dryer at a factory in Akure, 300km from Lagos.
The team was interested in collecting some data about the dryer, in order to look into its efficiency.
Mr Adeoya welcomed Dr Graffham's interest and some months later, he was visited by NRI agricultural engineering specialist, Dr Andrew Marchant.
Improvements included reduced fuel usage from 374 to 65 litres per tonne of dried product; increased output from approximately 100kg an hour to around 330kg an hour of dried product; and increased efficiency, from 11 to 55 percent.
Building on CAVA2's experience and progress with the fabricator in Nigeria, a complementary initiative is taking shape in Ghana, with the development of a new, fuel-efficient flash dryer on a smaller scale.
The University of Lagos, UNILAG Muslim Community, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the merit award conferred on dedicated Nigerians who have proved to be exceptional in public service.
Chairman, UNILAG Muslim Community, Prof.
Lai Olurode, in a commendation letter made available to The Guardian, applauded the recognition of the Comptroller-General of Nigeria Customs Service, Hameed Ali and that of Registrar, Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof.
Ishaq Oloyede as deserving of productivity merit award.
Olurode said: 'The two institutions are truly exceptional and had really shown that we need not be consistently skeptical about our own goodness.
'Perhaps, there are thousands outside of these two individuals who can perform far better.
The lesson in these exceptional case studies is for other public office holders to take note of factors that had assisted the rise of these organizations to pockets of effectiveness,' he stated.
Olurode however enjoined government to ensure that other moribund institutions rise to performance.
'At the UNILAG Muslim Community, we congratulate them for their being specially recognised by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
We urge them to keep up the good job and begin to mentor others for institutional effectiveness so that their exit would not usher a reversal of successes that had been attained.
Individuals cannot travel far but institutions can,' he said.
He said that measures were installed to address challenges by ensuring efficiency and cost effectiveness in the industry, as well as the privatisation of the port.
Although it has been temporarily suspended by the Federal Government, there are, however, several underlining factors that still surround the operations of the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD).
'We shall develop and enhance safety enforcement, minimise environmental damage and provide clear framework to enable investors to participate in maritime projects to improve growth and competiveness within the subsector,' Moghalu said.
Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chairman , Partners for Electoral Reforms (PEF) says the jailing of former Gov. Orji Kalu of Abia was a proof that joining the ruling party with criminal case was not a guarantee against justice.
Nwagwu in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja said that the jailing has faulted the notion that once people with criminal record join the ruling party they were covered.
NAN reports that Kalu was on Thursday convicted of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Federal High Court in Lagos after he was found guilty of N7.2 billion fraud and money laundering.
'The judgment is a good boost for the anti-corruption fight, especially against the background of all the noise about once somebody is in the All Progressives Congress (APC) the person cannot be brought to justice.

'It is a good signal that even if you join the ruling party you will not clog the will of justice.
'It also signals the fact that no matter how long it last, once there is the determination by the court to bring justice, justice would be done.
'We are excited about the judgment and we hope that it is also brought to bear on the Babachir Lawal's case and other cases of people with a criminal record who think that being in the ruling party is a guarantee against justice,' he said

Nigeria may miss SDG on healthcare, says Soludo
Former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has said that if the Federal Government does not initiate good reforms, the country may miss out on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on healthcare.
Soludo spoke at the 26th Annual Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) Development Forum themed 'The Nigerian Healthcare Situation: The Way Forward' in Abuja.
According to him, tackling healthcare challenges in the country requires decisive and comprehensive war on poverty, inequality, illiteracy or poor public health education, nutrition, water and sanitation, as well as provision of adequate and accessible public health facilities and insurance schemes.
'The United Nations SDG 3 envisions that by 2030 all countries should ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages.'There are about 13 specific targets to meet.
From all indications, Nigeria is set to miss the targets and the SDG on health except some dramatic and systematic reforms are initiated and sustained from now until 2030,' he said.
Government's expenditure on health (like other sectors) needs to be ratcheted up and its facilitation and regulatory functions strengthened, he said, adding that serious attention at fora like that, should also focus on maximising the latent potential of the 'other hand' (individuals and non-state actors) in reversing what LAPO identifies as the 'progressive decline' of healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
He noted that the country's healthcare statistics was as scary as its poverty and unemployment statistics, using the average life expectancy as summary indicator.
The former governorship aspirant in Anambra State identified a strong correlation between poverty/inequality and health.He explained that the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provided for free and compulsory primary education, as well as free secondary education.
In his opening remarks, chairman, LAPO Board of Directors, Dr. Osarenren Emokpae, called on the federal and state governments to increase budgetary allocation for the health sector.He said the increment would help reduce medical tourism, as some of the elite would begin to patronise local health facilities rather than go abroad.
In 2018, Nigeria was ranked 187 out of 191 countries in the world that are not complying with the Universal Health Coverage (UCH), he noted, adding that LAPO, in its inclusive services to its clients and the general public, made healthcare a very important component of its services.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LAPO, Godwin Ehigiamusoe, said the country's health sector required urgent and collective attention and action, adding that the healthcare statistics in some cases were very depressing.
Nnamdi Kanu's lawyer declared wanted

'And I will seek the cooperation of law-abiding Nigerians from North, South, East and West, wherever they find this individual, they should report to the nearest police station or any other security agency for possible arrest and prosecution.'

Residents flee town of Kanu's lawyer after policemen's death
A siege allegedly laid to Oraifite in Ekwusigo Local Government of Anambra State by a combined team of soldiers and policemen forced residents to flee the community yesterday.
The desertion of the community came on the heels of declaration of Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer to the Supreme Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, wanted by the state police command over an alleged killing of Oliver Innoma Abbey, the Oraifite Area Commander and the SARS Commander, Ichi Sector, Patrick Agbazue.
The two officers led a police patrol team to the compound of Ejiofor in Oraifite, where the police allegedly shot at three persons and wounded scores of others suspected to belong to IPOB.
It was learnt that the seeming police invasion of the house of the counsel to Kanu, who had three days earlier buried one of his elder brothers, irked some youths in the area who allegedly launched a reprisal attack, which is believed to have resulted in the death of Abbey and Agbazue whose remains were burnt and buried near a village market.
The police and IPOB have given differing accounts of the incident in which not less than 20 houses and shops have been razed.
Revving critical national issues as Madueke launches autography
Admiral Allison MaduekeNo doubt, the story of the 30-month Nigerian Civil War of 1967 would remain a critical point for discussion anytime Nigeria is being examined in history to project for a better future.
So also the agitation for restructuring and June 12, 1993, presidential election, acclaimed to have been won by the late business mogul, Chief M.K.O Abiola but annulled by the then military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. 
These issues seem recurring and cannot be overlooked as they impact on national discourse.
Twenty-one years since Nigeria returned to civil rule, those factors that led to the civil war, the unending agitations for restructuring and the perceived domination of governance system by a particular section of the country are still visible markers that still haunt the country and continue to stifle its development.
As a matter of fact, most of the issues have not been adequately tackled many leas put in proper perspectives in a manner that could have helped in reshaping the nation's growth and development.
These factors were part of issues that were publicly deliberated upon, when former Chief of Naval Staff and one-time Military Administrator of Anambra and the Imo State, Admiral Allison Madueke (rtd), launched his autobiography last week.
It is entitled Riding the Storms, with God in My Sails at MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos.
Seeking inclusiveness through regional development commissions
Oduah
The quest for the establishment of development commissions for the remaining geo-political zones in the country apart from the South-south and Northeast gained momentum recently with the introduction of three bills to that effect in the Senate.
Onyedika Agbedo looks at the genesis of the move, the gimmicks around it and its likely outcome in this report.
There is a cool 'war' in the Senate among the geo-political zones in the country following penultimate Wednesday's reintroduction of a bill seeking to establish the South East Development Commission.
The 8th Senate had passed the bill, sponsored by Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North) on December 12, 2018, but it did not get President Muhammadu Buhari's assent.
Should the bill secure the nod of the lawmakers again and possibly receive presidential assent this time around, it would give birth to a commission charged with the responsibility of receiving and managing funds specially allocated by the Federal Government for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and reparation for lost houses and businesses of victims of the Nigerian civil war.
The commission would also address any other environmental or developmental challenges confronting the zone.
Clause 15 (2a) of the bill, which identifies source of funding for the commission, stipulates that the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total monthly statutory allocation due to the member states of the commission shall be from the Federation Account.
It also seeks the establishment of a governing board for the commission, which shall include one person each from the other five geopolitical zones of the country.
South-East NYSC coordinator inaugurates entrepreneurship centre in Aba
Alhaji Ahmed Ikaka, the South East Zonal Coordinator, National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), on Tuesday inaugurated a new Skills Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SAED) Centre built by corps members serving in Osisioma, near Aba.
Speaking at the event, Ikaka lauded the efforts of the corps members, saying that NYSC was leading the economic revolution in Nigeria with the skill acquisition training given to corps members.
He assured Nigerians of better economy with the series of training given to corps members to make them self-reliant.
He said that Nigeria had no reason to be patronising foreign goods when its youths creatively produce such goods.
READ ALSO: The NYSC uniform controversy
The NYSC boss, therefore, urged Nigerians to patronise local manufacturers and assist them to strengthen their economy.
'We should produce what we consume. We have the best skills in the world. You have seen from the exhibition we had here the production of shoes, hats, clothings and other things.
'We have seen also those in agro-allied, food production and processing.
'We cannot be deceiving ourselves, no nation develops on importation.
The life of a nation depends on the skills of its citizens and none develops beyond the citizens' skills.
'So NYSC is changing Nigeria's narrative by developing the skills of these corps members and they are becoming job creators, instead of job seekers.
'A lot of NYSC members are contributing to the economic development of our nation.
'This is the only way we can move forward, we cannot continue to deceive ourselves,' Ikaka said.
He said that corps members had learnt to write business proposals, given loan windows with Bank of Industry offering N2 billon, Central Bank providing N400 million, Heritage Bank fund, NYSC Foundation fund and Credit Direct fund.
He said with about N10 million available for corps members to access, it will be easy for them to succeed outside the service and improve Nigeria's economy.
The state NYSC Coordinator, Lady Bona Fasakin, said that Osisioma Local Government Area (LGA) had been partners in progress with NYSC.
Fasakin said that the council provided the land, where the centre was built, adding that by that act the council had keyed into the vision of the scheme in its fight against unemployment.
She urged other councils and stakeholders in Abia to emulate Osisioma's example by providing skills training equipment to sustain the vision and ensure that corps members become job providers.
She further called for support for NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers so that rural dwellers would benefit from the programme.
The Transition Chairman of Osisioma LGA, Mr Ugochukwu Nwaogu, said the council would continue to assist in making life better for the corps members serving in the area.
Nwaogu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Joseph Iguodo, said the council would seek ways to provide a lodge for corps members in the area.
The council boss pledged N50,000 donation to support NYSC programmes in the area.
The Local Government Zonal Inspector, Mrs Ruth Jacob, thanked the council for its support, while commending the corps members for their commitment in actualising the project.
Jacob said that the centre had taught the corps members how to produce many items that could enhance their economy and contribute to the nation's socio-economic development.
(Updated) Supreme court removes prominent Oyo monarch, Eleruwa of Eruwa
Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola
By Adeola Badru
Twenty-one years after he ascended the throne of his forebears, the Eleruwa of Eruwa, Oba Samuel Adegbola has been dethroned by the Supreme Court on Friday morning.
Vanguard recalls that an Oyo State High Court had on January 26, 2011 removed.
But not satisfied, he appealed the judgement.
The sacked monarch was installed the Eleruwa in 1998 by the Oyo State Government amidst protracted protests by members of the rightful ruling house after the last Eleruwa, the late Oba Bolanle Olaniyan, who is from the Akalako ruling house, passed on , on May 1, 1994.
Although his nomination and selection by the kingmakers were challenged by the Laribikusi house, which argued that he was not a member of the ruling arm, but belonged to Akalako where the previous king emerged, the state government went ahead to inaugurate him, prompting the present action.

When Nigeria's slow wheel of justice caught up with Uzor Kalu
After a 12-year trial period, Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, was yesterday brought to book for offences committed against his people.
In the wake of Nigeria's return to democratic governance in 1999, Kalu was one of the governors elected to steer the affairs of the states of the federation and help fulfill the yearnings of the masses for purposeful governance and true development.
But amid actions that simulated development and got praise singers christening him 'the messiah,' he plundered the state's till, grossly under-developed his people and set the tone for their sustained impoverishment.
Shortly after stepping down as governor in 2007, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) took him to court on a 39-count charge bordering on diversion of about N7.65 billion from the state's purse.
And yesterday, after a drawn trial, he was handed a 12-year jail sentence at a Federal High Court in Lagos by presiding judge, Mohammed Idris, for money laundering.
In addition to the sentence, Justice Idris ordered that Kalu's company, Slok Nigeria Limited, be liquidated and its assets forfeited to the Federal Government.
The senator, Slok Nigeria Limited and Udeh Udeogu, a former director of finance and accounts in Abia, were found complicit in the diversion.

Betty Akeredolu: We'll not relent until women are treated fairly
The wife of Ondo State governor, Arabinrin Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has vowed not to relent until women are given equal rights as their male counterparts.
Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu spoke on Wednesday during the 2nd summit of Forum for Women Officials of Ondo State and Female Appointees (FOWOSO) held at International Culture and Event Centre in Akure, the state capital.
'We will not faint until we see women everywhere being treated with as much respect as their male counterparts.
'The pursuit of gender quality is definitely daunting, many rocks of stereotypes are particularly exerting, but when men join us, we are further strengthened to prevail quickly. But, whatever the case , we shall prevail,' she said.
She called for gender inclusiveness in all aspects of the socio-economic, saying that ' spectrum is still miles ahead. We know this and we are not going to relent.'
Anyanwu-Akeredolu, who is the founder of FOWOSO, noted that her motivation was not because she is a woman.
She called for a society where continuous development was achieved and sustained.
'We must come to the understanding that everyone, regardless of gender is needed for sustainable development.
'I have dedicated my life to driving gender equality, not because I love female folk more ,but because I seek the growth and advancement of humanity as a whole.
'I am very delighted to know that I have infected every FOWOSO member with this positive virus that strives for gender equality in every aspect of our socio-economic spectrum,' she explained.
Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described as unquantifiable the training and empowerment of women in the state by FOWOSO.
He said the activities of the forum, particularly in the areas of training and empowerment of women across the 18 local government areas, had produced many entrepreneurs.
Speaking on the theme of the summit; 'Prioritising Women's Health and Well Being In Nigeria', Akeredolu said his administration had prioritised the well-being of women in the state.
He added: 'We have prioritised women health and well-being in Ondo State and that was what led to the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health Scheme which we launched on Wednesday. All you need to access the free health care for pregnant women is your residency cards. Every child under 5 is entitled to free health care in Ondo State.'
'Let me commend the efforts of the founder for this laudable initiative geared towards the development of womenfolk in Ondo State,' Akeredolu stated.
The Chairman of 2nd FOWOSO Planning Committee, Mrs Mercy Femi-Idris, described the forum as significant to health and welfare of women, adding that it was about nurturing and empowering female folks.
Prof. Modupe Adelabu, the Chairman of the occasion, noted that FOWOSO had given women voice of recognition.
Adelabu, the former director governor of Ekiti State, said the forum had eliminated discrimination against women, noting that FOWOSO was a fun-making gathering but a life-impacful organisation.
Mrs Bisi Fayemi, the wife of Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi and Mrs Kafayat Oyetola, the wife of Osun State governor attended the summit.
How to boost cyber security – experts
Stakeholders the Nigerian cyber security space under the aegis of the Information Security Society of Africa-Nigeria (ISSAN) have called for collaborations in boosting cyber security in the country.
They made the call while speaking at a Cyber Security Workshop Themed: 'DDoS Evolution – Staying Protected' organised by ISSAN in collaboration with 21st Century Technologies Limited in Lagos.
While welcoming stakeholders at the Workshop, President of ISSAN, Dr. David Isiavwe, decried the worsening state of cyber security in the country.
He said, 'Those who watch the cyber space closely, will all agree that there is a lot of happenings each and every day.
New forms of attacks are being contrived and implemented by the bad guys, and all they need is one successful attempt.
We hear of all the various attacks both on individuals and companies alike.
Indeed, even the cyber security gatekeepers are not spared.
And huge sums of money are at risk each time there is a successful attack.'
Dr. Isiavwe who is also the Group Head Operations & Technology, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, further lamented the fact that everyone and every institution was susceptible to these attacks as social engineering attack is unrelenting.
He said data based manipulation-insiders and outsiders is on the rise, attack on card data and card processing technology infrastructure via rogue IT infrastructure, spear phishing attack and combination of different methodologies were rampant.
He therefore called on all stakeholders to be proactive, create customer awareness activities, continuous and automated monitoring of systems and infrastructure, employment of Artifucial intelligence and Machine Learning as well as robotics and data analytics.
He also called for collaborations among stakeholders.
Speaking on the theme of the workshop in a keynote address, Long Lee Shih – DDoS Security Expert, Nexusguard Ltd, also explained how individuals and organisations could avoid being victims of cyber attacks, including Origin Protection (OP) for large networks, among others.
His keynote address was followed by a robust plenary session that included Dr Wale Obadare, MD/COO, Digital Encode Ltd; Long Lee Shih, Ighoakpo Eduje, Chief Information Security Officer, Heritage Bank Ltd; Igboa Abumere, Chief Information Security Officer, Stanbic IBTC Bank; Bharat Soni, Chief Information Security Officer, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Dr. David Isiavwe.
Hit-and-run driver kills woman in Awka
A yet to be identified woman was on Sunday killed by a hit-and-run driver in Awka.
The accident occurred at about 11:05pm at Regina Caeli Junction on the Enugu-Onitsha expressway.
According to Mr Andrew Kumapayi, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Anambra, the accident left the woman dead instantly.
Kumapayi said the corpse had been deposited at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital morgue, Awka.
The sector commander reiterated the call for pedestrians to be careful on the road, especially during festive periods, because of increased vehicular movement.
'My advice to road users especially pedestrians during this season is to be extra careful when crossing the road.
'They should endeavour to use the pedestrian bridge provided for them if any, and if there is none, they should look left, right and left again to make sure that the road is free before crossing.
'Let them wear reflective clothes when walking in the night so that they can be seen by oncoming vehicles,' he said.
What Onitsha fire tells us about the petrol tankers from hell [Pulse Opinion]
The Onitsha fire accident was totally avoidable. Yet again, Nigeria has killed citizens whose only crime was hustling in a country that never got their backs.
Onitsha, the Anambra state capital, is mourning. And all of Nigeria with it.
On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, a petrol laden tanker rammed into buildings in an Onitsha market, spilled its contents in the neigborhood and sparked a fire that ravaged buildings, consumed goods worth millions of Naira and ended lives.
Onitsha was a ball of fire for hours and no one lifted a finger. The city is still counting its losses.
The casualty figures from the incident are still hazy at the time of writing, but it has been confirmed that a mother and her child were among the dead; 
With the fire searing through their skins and leaving them locked in each other's arms until the very end.
The fire incident in Onitsha yesterday is sad and regrettable. I am profoundly touched by the sight of the charred remains of an innocent mother and her child, who are victims of this tragedy,' said President Muhammadu Buhari.
Former Nigeria Vice President and presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar said: 'We've had many preventable fuel tanker tragedies.
I received with sadness, reports of a tanker explosion in Onitsha, Anambra State, which caused massive destruction to lives and properties in Ochanja Market area.
My prayers and thoughts are with the families of the affected.'
TV personality Ebuka Obi-Uchendu said: 'Last night was a lot. 
We really are on our own in this country.
Those images from Onitsha are still so heartbreaking.
May the departed Rest In Peace.'
One of the biggest takeaways from the tragedy is that the fire raged for hours with no fire service truck anywhere near the scene of the inferno.
And like Atiku mentioned, this is one of several petrol tanker accidents in recent times across Nigeria that has led to loss of lives.
Apart from the Otedola bridge fire incident of June 2018 in Lagos that led to loss of lives and the burning of cars, there have been several instances where a petrol laden tanker, flouting all known traffic laws in the land, goes ahead to inflict pain and misery on innocent families and ordinary Nigerians.
In Lagos where this writer resides, petrol tanker and articulated truck drivers derive immense joy from intimidating other road users, offloading their containers on busy roads and obstructing free flow of traffic.
Articulated trucks and petrol tankers have been a menace in Nigeria for as long as anyone can remember and the regulatory agencies or authorities have largely looked the other way unperturbed for decades.
Until the next disaster.
'I call on the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Road Safety Commission and other stakeholders to urgently address the issue of safety standards in Nigeria, with a view to stemming the frequency of these tragedies.
May the souls of the dead rest in peace Amen,' President Buhari said, without stating how he will make sure the agencies he mentioned sanitize our roads and put the killer truck drivers in check.
Without saying how he'll lead the charge in enforcing compliance.
It is also a shame that a state as rich as Anambra has no functioning fire service department or emergency response units; and that when tragedy struck, Governor Willie Obiano was not on the ground to provide succour.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the Onitsha inferno was completely avoidable. Yet again, we have lost lives to poor governance across all tiers. Writer Ayo Sogunro was right after all when he said 'everything in Nigeria is going to kill you.'

Former players of Sunshine Stars, Sunshine Queens, Rising Stars and Rising Queens on Tuesday in Akure, Ondo State, disrupted the training session of Sunshine Stars FC over the non-payment of their sign-on fees.
The ex-players chased members of the team away from the Ondo State Sports Complex, Akure.
Former Sunshine Queens player, Esther Michael, told journalists that she got injured while playing for the club but was abandoned to her fate.
Michael added that she had remained without a job since sustaining a career-threatening injury five years ago while playing for the club.
She disclosed that no form of help came from the management of the Ondo State Football Agency since that period.
She said, 'For almost five years after I was injured and spent my entire earnings on treating myself, I have had no job.
'We are therefore appealing to Ondo State Government to help us out.
'I played almost five years for this team, the injury I had, government and management didn't help me. So, they should pay us our money.'
Former Sunshine Stars player, James Moses, said government should honour the agreement it entered into with the players and pay them their sign-on fees.
Moses, fondly called 'Okomu' in his playing days by fans, said the love they had for the team had prevented them from taking legal action against the management.
He said, 'The state has been owing us sign-on fees for long and we have been begging for them to pay us.
'Sunshine was my first club, I love Sunshine so much. I want them to pay us our money that is due to us.
'We are calling on the state governor to help us because some of us have families to take care of.'
In his reaction, Tajudeen Akinyemi, Chairman, Ondo State Football Agency, said the previous government agreed to pay the money in 15 instalments but was only able to offset eight.
Akinyemi said the file for the remaining seven months had been sent to the Head of Service, who had raised the issue with the governor of the state.
He promised that government would accelerate action on the file to ensure that the former players were paid.

EXCLUSIVE: Davido: 'No Money Osun State Can Make In 40 Years That My Dad Hasn't Made'
*Why I stayed away from Nigeria for 8 months
Nigerian singer David Adeleke, aka Davido, says there is no money Osun State can make in the next 40 years that his father, Adedeji Adeleke, has not already made as the 'omo baba olowo' crooner revealed why he stayed away from Nigeria for eight months.
A similar controversial statement regarding the paltry financial capacity of Osun was made by the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.
Contrary to beliefs that Davido was away from the country to promote his music on the international scene, the singer said he had to leave the country of some time due to the fillers he was getting that the government was after him.
According to him, he needed to protect his family and associates which he was why he left the country.
The singer made this known at his album private listening event, Wednesday night, which held at Landmark Events, Victoria Island, where he disclosed that if he had chosen to stay things would not have gone smoothly for him as the government were beginning to track his activities.
The singer whose album, 'A Good Time', will be released in October while fielding questions from MTV Base TV host, Ehiz, said, 'With the whole politics thing it was first about family.
Honestly, it was first about family.
I was in Osun with my guys.
We saw everything in plain sight.
Let me tell you a story about my uncle.
My uncle is the last born of the family.
The original politician of the family is Serubawon, my father's elder brother.
'He was the first governor of Osun state; came back then went for senator you know when everybody for the state knows that this is the next governor and then we just woke up one day and they said he went to eat somewhere and he died.
'Yoruba culture when somebody holds an office and he passes on they either give the bride or the close relatives.
The next in line is B red's daddy and he is just a happy person.
He doesn't like politics but when you lose your brother everybody knows what's up.
With that, they wanted to give my uncle automatically.
'A day to them swearing him in as senator they said no we want to do re-election another guy has come up and my father doesn't like wahala so he said let's go to the other party if we lose we pack our thing and go.
The next day we did election my uncle cleared 16 out of 17 local government areas.
'He became a senator in just a week.
His own journey to winning that governorship primary election was out of sight that was how we knew this one nah God.
'It was painful and will tell everybody here that was the real reason I was not even in the country because of the politics.
I have to watch what I say.
If I was around he no go dey OK for me and my people.
So I had to be a man and say look let me stay away.
'We have Adeleke University all the roads that lead was done by my father.
There's no money Osun wants to make in the next 30 to 40 years that my father has not made.
The way things turned out was crazy.
When asked if he got any backlash for doing what he did, he said no.
According to him, he met an APC chieftain at a wedding in Paris wherethey both shared a joke.
He said he 'felt shebi una don take am'.
That's why I'm back, he explained.
'I'm praying every day for the country.
Everybody is complaining why you talking about politics.
I have an American passport I could have chosen to stay there.
But this is home and I am comfortable here.'
EXCLUSIVE: EFCC Quizzes Ondo Poly Bursar, Registrar Over Funds Misappropriation
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has quizzed the Registrar of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic Owo, Ondo State, Mr Sule Atiku, and the Bursar of the institution, Mr Matthew Adejuwon, over alleged financial impropriety.
SaharaReporters gathered on Wednesday that the two men were 'drilled' for authorising the sum of N68m from the treasury of the school without due process.
A source, who confided in our correspondent, said that, 'The Registrar and Bursar of the institution were at the EFCC on Tuesday and they were quizzed over the role they played in allegedly misappropriating the funds of the institution.
'They were there with their lawyers and brought some documents to defend themselves.
'Our investigations showed that the Bursar had his authorised signature on some of the documents which also implicated him as an accomplice.
Two of them (Bursar and the Registrar) were accomplices in the ongoing corruption and fraud perpetrated at the polytechnic.
A senior management officer of the school also confirmed the questioning of the two men during a chat SaharaReporters.
He said, 'Yes, it is true that the two men have honoured the invite of the EFCC and they have been quizzed but I don't know if they were detained.
I noticed I did not see them in school today (Wednesday).
When contacted on Wednesday evening over the matter, spokesperson for the institution, Mr Ojo Samuel, could not be reached as his telephone line was switched off.
Recall that the EFCC had last month invited and quizzed both the Chairman, Governing Board of the school, Mr Banji Alabi; the Rector, Gani Ogundahunsi; Deputy Rector (Academics), and Mr Olorunwa Lawson after a petition was received by the agency.
Some aggrieved lecturers of the school had accused the management of the institution of allegedly diverting and using some illegal means to misappropriate the school's fund into private purse.
Sources at the EFCC had earlier told SaharaReporters that there are documents linking the principal officers of the polytechnic to the financial misappropriation.
EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason I was Assaulted –FUTA Student Brutalised By Colleagues.
She was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.
Boluwatife Adekunle, the female undergraduate of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, who was physically assaulted by two ladies and a guy all said to be student of the institution, has given more insight into why she was attacked.
The young lady, who says she wants justice served, told SaharaReporters on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, that she was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her.
Adekunle revealed that she was assaulted in one of the private hostels outside the school campus by the group in a bid to be disgraced among fellow students.
She said, 'The whole issue started few weeks ago.
I and one of the ladies in the video called 'Faith' were roommates in a hostel outside campus.
'Her boyfriend began asking me out but I felt it was not proper for me to date him.
I rejected his advances.
'But instead of him to leave me alone, the guy kept disturbing me, so I had to report him to Faith because I don't want trouble.
FUTA Female Student Brutalised For Calling Colleagues 'Runs Girls'
'Before then, I had been having some issues with Faith as she had been living a wayward life on campus which I didn't like.
'From that point, she started seeing me as talking bad about her to people around our area.
'During this period, her boyfriend kept pestering me to date him but I refused.
'Instead of Faith to caution her boyfriend, she accused me of planning to sleep with her man.
'On the day that I was assaulted, she invited me to a room in one of the hostels and boyfriend and other ladies were inside the place already.
'Immediately I entered the place, they locked the door and asked me to kneel down while the guy was asking if he ever asked me for a date.
'Since I refused to kneel down, they began to beat me and also tried to strip me naked.
'They used a stick to hit me on my head and punched me on my face.
The guy used horse whip to flog me several times.
'They said they would make sure they disgraced me on campus, I pleaded with them but they refused and I was about to faint when they stopped beating me.
'As I speak, I feel pains all over my body due to the beatings.
Their plan was to kill me.
I want them arrested and face the consequences of their action.'
While condemning the attack on her daughter, the victim's mother, Mrs Florence Adekunle, said they wanted justice over the matter.
Former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, and rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known as Segalink, have condemned the expulsion of a student of Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, over a Facebook post, an open letter to the Inspector-General of Police and his alliance with pro-democracy and human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore.
Shehu Sani, who took to his Twitter handle to express his grievance, said, 'Expelling students and sacking workers over Facebook or Twitter postings is likely to intensify in view of the growing culture of intolerance to criticisms and the establishment discomfort with the social media.'
Also reacting to the issue, Segalink wrote, 'By the grace of God, we shall be taking up this case.
The level of impunity in our citadel of knowledge is astronomical.
An example will be made of this abuse of power by people who should know better.
Kindly advise Ifemosu Michael to reach out, so we can be properly briefed and take up the matter for justice to be served.
He is no longer alone.
However, despite the outcry the expulsion of Ifemosu by on the orders of the Vice Chancellor, Prof Felix Salako, the university's management are yet to give any statement on the issue.
