I understand if the salary, three flat rooms and SUV are enough for you and as a result, cause a lack of purpose for the land where you were born
I too have a passion for Nigeria and include other citizens like Omoyele Sowore, who have experienced despair and abandonment
Seeking a revolt without a gun or going to overthrow a government is not and will not be illegal
It is not a crime to stand up for one's conscience by seeking change
It is this that has led to democracy as a system of government which is defined as "government of the people, by the people and given to the people".
If protesting and calling #Regurrence is now illegal, the courts should convict Omoyele Sowore of holding him for more than 120 days
So, knowing that your silence or your involvement in civil society in the face of opposition, crime and social ills does not make you a good person
You have no vision and you are only self-aware
You see, I am writing this post because someone told me to shut up on Sowore talk and focus on my business on whatsapp, and I laughed
He is going to read this article, so I will not mention his name where the viewer does not agree with my beliefs.
For you, the reader, know that the purpose of this statement when you are told "your mind is on your business" is not just to sell your product
It is also about showing interest in your country and speaking out against the violations and violations of social norms, minorities, and minorities.
If your country is a banana republic where people are being tried in the middle of the day, what will happen to your business and your intention to trade with international producers?
Every business knows what they are doing, complaining every year at the end of every year including a focus on technology, politics, social and economic environment.
This skill of environmental research, which is important to write such a complaint is the responsibility of the Public Relations Practioner, who has the intelligence, skills and character to conduct research and development in the community and make complaints to the management and team leaders or master it serves for good planning
Yes, this helps to organize and coordinate with business executives about the potential benefits of the business environment as well as the potential risks for a successful business.
It is not as expensive to work as you are in the blood from the development of the environment in which you live and live
For example, with the deteriorating health care system in our country today, if a person is involved in a minor accident or becomes ill with a medical condition that is minor or neglected where there is good health care, such a thing can lead to the death of the person
As criminal law has become a tradition in 1984, let me be clear that a good foreign businessman would be afraid to do business in Nigeria knowing that he is a good citizen who is respected and a good leader like Omoyele Sowore. is a person who will go to court, anything that will happen to him including his business
If you put this in many cases of fraud, bribery, bankruptcy and the lack of public resources, how do you think the wealthy Monaco, who saw a real business opportunity in Nigeria would still be looking for
so, when you think you are silent is a long speech, I do not agree
how exactly it is a matter of length or silence in the face of injustice
One of the most dangerous things for any business that violates the law and the rule of law, fairness and the right to a hearing
Businesses thrive by complying with the law and having a fair and public justice system without fear or favor
to dispel any doubts, here are a few of the other things any man or woman who wants to trade land is not where he was born:
1. Political, personal and economic blessings
2. Skill work
3. tax money
4. Travel and efficiency
5. Their wealth and glory
without respect given the second and fourth marks, let me be clear that no trader will leave his land for profit if the other elements of this text are in the first place. this article does not exist
The first article in the series addresses the opposition to Omoyele Sowore and his supporters and sends a message of legal disregard and impartiality.
So, I think the government should look at this issue and think about us as customers, who are trying to have a relationship with other big companies and a better way to get wealth and provide services to more than just children. 30 million Nigerian youths touring the country did nothing
Ayo Moses Ogedengbe is a marker in public relations

by the spokesperson of the company, Wilson Uwujaren, marking the property by order of Judge Mohammed Idris on the 5th of December 2019 at the Ikoyi High Court, and Lagos
Letters from Sun and Slok Nigeria Ltd are among the Kalu property marked by the EFCC
Former governor of Abia state jailed for 12 years, passing away for more than 7.5 billion shillings
As Orji Uzor Kalu goes to prison, FFK and Patience Jonathan will be joined by Churchill Okonkwo
Finally, while Senator Kalu was imprisoned, arguments against Femi Fani-Kayode, Patience Jonathan and Tinubu were to be taken into consideration.
If convicted, they paid the fine and were sentenced to several years in prison.
This is the first way to eradicate crime in Nigeria
The crucial factor in the fight against crime in Nigeria is the lack of impunity for anyone who commits various crimes.
What better way to do it than to send a criminal criminal to Nigeria and the Fourth Republic, Orji Uzor Kalu in prison.
With this punishment, and the conviction that the court will carry it out, you will know why many of us who compare Muhammadu Buhari, feel sad for our struggle against crime is ridiculous.
Although we are happy, we are confident, that the fight against crime in Nigeria is now worthwhile.
However, we are optimistic that a fair trial will be held for the likes of Bola Tinubu, Patience Jonathan, Olisa Metu, Femi Fani-Kayode and others.
Before Orji Uzor Kalu joined the All Progressives Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, he made Abia state empty.
He made Abia state the worst governor in the Fourth Republic with Theodore Orji
Happily, Orji Uzor Kalu said in a Facebook post that he had joined the APC because of Buhari's promise that South-East contractors would not go ahead with the project. before November.
I joined the APC because Buhari has fulfilled his promise to me and I hope he will do better.
As an award to join the APC, President Buhari handed over a number of road projects to SLOK Holding contractors.
Also, the Niger Delta Development Commission provided funding to SLOK Holding to build a road from Mzuhali to Mzuakoli and from Uzuakoli to Ozuitem.
In the unfortunate case of Senator Orji Uzor Kalụ, his court case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission could not be as expected.
With his conviction, the prospect of becoming president under the APC in 2023 has come to an abrupt end.
With this conviction, Nigerians expect more pending criminal offenses against those who have served the public.
Now Kalu is in jail, people like Tinubu, Patience Jonathan, Olisa Metu, Femi Fani-Kayode will complain about how they have served the public.
Sending the Senate to prison will help to get the Buhari staff to stay away from crime.
With Kalu's conviction, Nigerians are optimistic and want to get back the $ 1.1 billion money that was deposited in the London Central Bank for Malabu oil by Goodluck Jonathan.
A court of law has ordered the recovery of $ 9.2 million and $ 8.4 million from Patience Jonathan, Goodluck Jonathan's ex-wife.
The question for the EFCC is why did they not tell the judge to put him in jail for his own financial gain?
Dr. Jonathan has jokingly said that the funds were donated by Nigerians in good faith, which he received as the wife of the deputy governor, the governor and the governor. What a joke.
It is ironic that the EFCC is not using the wording of the complaint against the two large cars full of Tinubu parked at his house the day after the 2019 presidential election.
Are the EFCC afraid to investigate Tinubu's spending and exports?
MA, the case against Fani-Kayode for embezzling N4.6 billion, which the Director of Publicity presented to Goodluck Jonathan's 2015 party has long been the subject of much controversy.
Why do these words still linger on one side?
Our courts regularly sent small thieves to prison every day.
Therefore, it is not a matter of a court order, but a matter for the Criminal Judges, the Chief Justice, and others who have taken bribes and remained silent.
And with the conviction of Senator Kalu, the criminal case of the ruling governors (now legislators) has been going on for a long time, should come to an end and those who violated the law, should be convicted and imprisoned.
Most importantly, the EFCC members will be reorganized and refined due to their vital work
Finally, while Senator Kalu was imprisoned, arguments against Femi Fani-Kayode, Patience Jonathan and Tinubu were to be taken into consideration.
If convicted, they paid the fine and were sentenced to several years in prison.
This is the first way to eradicate crime in Nigeria

Oshiomhole has said, 'We also know that Standard Chartered House and Stanbic House are South African buildings, and Nigerians can benefit from them if they take their own.
It is time to speed up the process so that Nigerian companies can reap the benefits of their departure and increase their productivity.
They will save a lot of money if we bring these businesses to Nigerians. '
However, Standard Chartered told Sahara media: 'Standard Chartered Bank of Nigeria Limited is owned by Standard Chartered Plc, a British company.

The Osun government has closed schools due to clashes between teachers and students
The message explained that fights broke out between many teachers and students, with the use of hands, knives and sticks causing panic in the area.
Osun state government has ordered the closure of Baptist High School, Gbodofon, Oshogbo, as several students attacked teachers and damaged school property, according to Flash, a local letter.
The Commissioner of Education, Mr. Oladoyin Folorunsho, issued this order while conducting an investigation into all the damages caused by the students.
The message explained that fights broke out between many teachers and students, with the use of hands, knives and sticks causing panic in the area.
A student who asked not to be named told reporters that the fight started last Wednesday when students did not know who they were when they entered the school.
He said, "We saw a lot of students on Wednesdays at school where they were so good, that everyone ran for their lives
However, it was difficult for a month to pass and we did not see anything like this and every time something like this happened, many of our angry students locked up their teachers in their offices.
This past Friday, they came to our school again and many more tolerant teachers joined them which caused a great deal of confusion among teachers and students.
Oladoyin, who expressed outrage at the students' misconduct and ordered a thorough investigation, said those who did so should be punished.
He said the amount of damage would indicate how much each student involved would have to pay to be a tutor to them.
Our response to the taking of Sowore's speech by the Attorney-General of our State from Femi Falana
For the sake of progress, we urge the AGF to immediately write a letter to stop the bad practices, which have caused embarrassment to our country.
Not to be outdone because it was the Attorney-General of our State and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who wrote the speech of Omoyele Sowore and wrote it to Dr. Hassan Liman (San).
But looking forward to court breach by the armed SSS, the AGF has decided to dismiss the panel and have the DPP prosecute.
As the amendment came to the conclusion that Sowore was not to be prosecuted by a court of law, the SSS refused to testify for the defendants as ordered by the courts.
However, hearing of the case has been postponed to February 20, 2020 in the wake of the trial.
As the matter becomes clear, the SSS is trying to obtain evidence to memorize Sowore.
Despite instructions from the AGF to look into the matter, the SSS summoned Sowore for a four-hour lengthy interview on Thursday.
The long question about the link between Sowore and the Boko Haram, IPOB and IMN groups, which he denied and strongly criticized.
In the case of Sowore, a member of the judiciary, Mr. Abubakar Marshal, saw the lengthy interview.
The SSS objective is to accuse Sowore of terrorism as well as the lack of allegations of presidential media coverage.
For the sake of progress, we urge the AGF to immediately write a letter to stop the bad practices, which have caused embarrassment to our country.
Proponents of her case have been working to make the actual transcript of this statement available online
He also expressed similar criticism of Obasanjo's support for Atiku's election
Wole Soyinka, Nigeria's only Nobel Laureate, says hate speech is a travesty and should be investigated psychologically.
He also expressed similar criticism of Obasanjo's support for Atiku's election
A well-known literary speaker spoke at a lecture in Abuja on Wednesday, but did not name Obasanjo or Atiku directly in his speech.
He questioned the change of heart of the former president, which Obasanjo's position has already been similar to that of his successor
In his words, "we will have a better idea.
If a person has been in a position for eight years, he has taught the community for eight years and after that, he will continue to educate people in the same way and say only 'This is the devil from hell', every year. eight levels and many years later the government says this is the devil and one day he changes and says this is your savior, which of the two is a hate story?
Obasanjo has criticized Atiku Renne, his deputy during his eight-year presidency
In his book 'My Watch', Obasanjo describes Atiku as a 'shameless hater'
Earlier, Obasanjo said God would not forgive him if he supported Atiku.
However, he turned his back on 2018 when he signed for Atiku Abubakar for the presidency
Continuing the lecture, entitled 'Nigeria 2019: Fighting Against Falsehoods' "Soyinka gave doctors urging the insane to join the fight against falsehood.
He said those who spread false rumors have intellectual problems.
He went on to say many things that had happened to him and how the news did not affect him, saying that he had heard stories about his death many times but various jokes that he did not gossip about.
He continued, "During the last presidency, there was a rumor that I said that it was good for President Jonathan to marry an uneducated woman.
I have not said anything about it yet and surprisingly look at it before me now
There is a Facebook page that uses my name and from time to time I get a message saying "Wole Soyinka says anyone who posts this person is stupid and has intellectual problems, his mother is goat while his father was a wrestler
"These things happen all the time and I personally do not want to underestimate the cause.
"Indeed, I know that those who spread falsehoods are mentally challenged and weak because they have no confidence in their faith and therefore give others their opinion."
"I am convinced that this is a serious matter and I do not want our misguided lawmakers to take the opportunity to impose such a law on us as a punishment for hate speech.
I do not know how far he has come, and they have taken him away or he is on the president's table and I have not said anything today and it will be like that person has no sense.
"If people want blood, join Boko Haram and not use the parliament to kill people for expressing their views like Khashoggi. Let's focus on that."
He gave a correction to the media as Facebook should help in the fight against false news.
He emphasized the need for INTERPOL and the international community to work together to fight this scourge.
Soyinka took the time to speak on the significance of Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Travel
"Two or three days ago, I read a reading where the minister should criticize the president and it was published in the media department and when I thoroughly researched even through images, and read the article often, it seems like i'm going to practice english because i can't find the exact wording
"So a lot of times, print media try to compete with the airwaves media but this is not because there is prestige, there are surprises and it does not hurt to present yourself as a bigger person than that. small that can reach the small, the problem of the community. "

Later in the day in Riyadh, Buhari will travel to Makkah, accompanied by his entourage, to perform the Umrah (pilgrimage of the minority) before returning to Abuja.
As President Buhari joined the PDP through Sonala Olumhense
The fact of the matter is that through the administration appointed by Buhari, he has resigned
any concealment of fighting against crime or any consequence. Yes
Elections have been a constant challenge to hope
Sonala Olumhense worked together
In the mid-1980s, I befriended a Nigerian army officer known as the 'Black Bag'.
His real name is Benjamin Adekunle, a young man with a reputation for killing many people during wartime.
Reports have it of how it breaks down and disrupts military operations against them, but also the older men it makes them in pain and crying.
By the time we saw it, I was a translator of our 'Letter of the Week' company located in Surulere where he lived.
With the drinking encouragement he brings, he discusses politics and books at home for hours.
Books?
I was amazed at how much a man loved books.
It has two large libraries, you can take any you want.
At one point, you have to sign for it and return it two weeks later.
Of course, the way he sees it, if you read those, you should get those drinks, to help answer questions and understand the motives behind it.
That was a new school for me: that a soldier known for inspiring is a person who builds himself up intellectually and culturally.
Black Scorpion has a deep boldness.
But it was his understanding that always puzzled me.
That kind of wealth is to be gained through training and travel, of course, but it is in the literature of other consciences — and they are often powerful.
This may be due to the fact that the agricultural system is in the process of being developed in a way that no one else can.
This is what came to my mind last week when I read the names of the caretakers appointed by President Muhammadu Buahri and sent to the legislature
I do not know the last day Buhari read or read a newspaper or magazine or even read any book since then.
Giving a private complaint about his health, I do not know the last day Buhari heard anything.
Not by hearing what people are saying on the street, on the radio or in pictures, but by seeing the ordinary things of a human being: the sound of a person entering a person's ear.
According to the definition of sound.
Because if Buhari could read or hear, or both, there was a gap between his energy and his comprehension, and his imagination.
According to him, there has been a gap between his words and his actions over the past four years
Take, for example, the appointment of current supervisors.
The list includes names that many Nigerians do not know, many of whom are well-known, and only a few who are described as talented musicians.
But most, according to credible reports, are full of thieves, looters, corrupt ministers and former governors, state thieves, central thieves, and central thieves. .
Yes, the Buhari who swore to eradicate crime, appointed or appointed them.
Buhari, who said many of them had failed in the first round because they were his guests when he appointed them, was re-appointed for five months by new ministers.
That is why, two and a half years ago, I said, "The Buhari administration has become a laughing stock, and the ability to do good in Nigeria has become a thing of the past."
In the weeks leading up to the election, Buhari, who has vowed to make Nigeria a better place, told the world that he would only select people he knew.
That one who stands for knowledge of only his family, should not.
If you already have the benefit of being known for the evils of the world, why not take the word of God for granted?
Under Buhari's administration, crime has increased dramatically.
Under Buhari, the All Progressives Congress (APC) party has become known for its criminality, incompetence and heartache.
It is a party where the political fathers own the state and take people's money, as shown by Bola Tinubu of Lagos and Adams Oshiomhole of Edo
Oshiomhole, who is also the current chairman of the APC, described the party's commitment during a rally in Benin last January: "There is no Nigeria or justice, only politics."
"Yes, as soon as you join the APC, all your sins are forgiven," he announced
Under Buhari, criticisms of Buhari's acquaintances disappear overnight, as in the case of two former governors / ministers who took over Lagos and Rivers state coffers.
Oshiomhole himself was arraigned in court and interrogated by police for taking large sums of money as a result of the council's election.
Under Buhari, the governor will be caught on camera posting millions of dollars in his uniform, according to Kano state governor Abdullahi Ganduje, and rejoicing in his stubbornness instead of suffering anger and is a research.
Or, if you are a former governor, like Danjuma Goje, who was free from the EFCC scrutiny by the president.
Because there is only APC.
Under Buhari, you do not have to qualify, or have the right certification: if you want one, you will earn one, or describe the size or the extent of your suffering.
Under Buhari, you do not have to produce anything to get a great choice, or produce anything if you are elected.
Under Buhari, any money you have is not for the public good or for any planned endeavor.
Money, also eaten by snakes or monkeys.
Under Buhari's rule, no criminal case has been filed against the government and no one has been convicted.
Observation has made it clear that the staff of the Buhari team being investigated or prosecuted may be exempt from prosecution or what I call 'Nollywood trials': going from year to year. 'years.
Rotimi Amaechi, the re-elected minister, presented the sample.
"I know governments that are very rich in an instant, but this is the money they need to build roads and provide things that will improve people's lives," he told a Nigerian youth group.
Note that he said exactly, "Suddenly," and "Billions" Not "Millions".
But note that there have been only seven Ministers in the ranks since the last 20 years, most of them working but only briefly.
Which of the following is a very rich man, Mr. Aquila?
He added that Amaechi made the remarks 24 hours after Buhari promised that the APC would lift one million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years.
In the words of the former governor.
"Our politicians need to make it clear how they can lift people out of poverty."
The fact is that, with the intentions of the British authorities, it has removed all barriers to warfare or counterfeiting.
His choice was to wash his hands and raise a chicken that gave people hope.
If we do not kill crime, crime will kill Nigeria. ' as he already says
Well, he did not or did not want to do it. But now that the storm is over, it is clear where Nigerian history is heading.
So far, they have taken that to heart, but all that remains is to apologize to the PDP, which does not require intellectual property.

What is the best way to describe a secret act or act that threatens the country, the law and the legislature, democracy and the way it acts?
The call of the people to the department of civil servants to be removed by the actions of the Legislature and the media from large to small, reorganized, reorganized into the ranks of the armed forces such as the Nigerian Police The wounds of this country cannot be cured by the harassment inflicted on them by intelligence agents in a defunct state of Nigeria.
What is the best way to describe a secret act or act that threatens the country, the law and the legislature, democracy and the way it acts?
who needs a modern safety net, a unique way of collecting intelligence, and does not know anything about modern methods to obtain the truth and lack of knowledge on how to prevent a terrorist threat?
The DSS needs an internal cleanup and should be expedited.
Someone like Peter AFunanya, a spokesman, should be thrown out for embarrassing a racist group that knows nothing about intelligence gathering, just roaming around like a dog fighting against the president.
The difficult question to ask is why did this bad government resort to hate speech against the rulers when the real enemy of the state is the bloodthirsty government?
I have worked in the past to educate the DSS and its sponsors that the security name given to them is 'national security'.
Its real name is 'modern security' which is covered as 'national security' to steal people and make criminals ignorant and trapped.
People will not be ruled out by secret intelligence groups that do not adhere to the rules that do not differentiate between Boko Haram and local social changers.
Sadly, Peter Afunanya is the DSS's defamation agent for his stupidity and the hatred he has inflicted on a separate video showing abuse of the court of law in the Federal High Court, in Abuja, n ‘Friday by the DSS.
Afunanya can not hide the fact that accepting a murderer's money is different from hiding a media show.
Cannot explain why DSS arrested Omoyele Sowore less than 24 hours after his release
As a bird's-eye viewer, Afunanya buried her head and the DSS in the sand without saying a word about the journalist and shooter of the human rights group who died in Bezarre.
Afunanya spoke half-truth in a secret joke for shameless and unprofessional conduct, as an embarrassing display of power at the table among the insecure public.
What good is a web site if it simply "blends in" with everything else out there?
What is the role of the DSS when members of a secret group commit suicide and cause chaos in this country every day?
Why did the DSS look into the Legislature and the legislature, and eliminate the error of intelligence, order and error in an orderly manner.
The time has come for the House of Representatives to look into the law that created the DSS for the happiness of Nigerians.
The DSS needs to be overhauled or completely dismantled and removed from being a small department under the president or people in positions of power.
If not, Nigerians will wake up one day and hear that the criminal has built his own court (DSS) to undermine Nigerians, democracy and civil development.

Sowore: Attack on the Court, The Consequences of the Fall of Democracy
we have seen these shows come to the fore several years ago, not just a few months ago and give us great interest.
It has literally meant something
Omoyele Sowore
BBC
The President of the African Democratic Congress, Ralph Nwosu, has slammed the fruits of his democratic rhetoric and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, and described it as a result of the collapse of his democracy.
Sowore was arraigned by the State Department of Justice at the Federal High Court last Friday, less than 24 hours after his release.
The practice has been criticized by local and international authorities but the Nigerian government says it is not affected.
In an interview with PUNCH, Nwosu said, "what happened in court was a clear indication of the failure of democracy.
They have seen the show that has been coming to us for many years, not just a few months ago and is of great interest to us.
it has come out in full.
When dictatorships begin, there will be many subtleties to guide the people, but when they come to fruition, problems arise.
In a speech on Tuesday, Banky-W described Nigeria as a country proud of torturing innocent people.
He said, "I am only grateful for the way our court has acted properly by releasing Omoyele Sowore.
Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and destroying the power, the will and the hope of the people,
Every time our leaders do wrong and pass away, our hearts go out to them
we are helpless, hopeless, we accept that it is so unknown, but there is nothing we can say or do to change it
"You do not have to be a candidate or a volunteer for Sowore to ensure that human rights and justice are not compromised.
The right to free speech and the right to freedom of movement are the fundamental rights of every Nigerian
May God bless all those in our legislature who are on the right side of the story by doing good
May God encourage, comfort and bless Sowore, his wife and his family as they go through these bad days only to find themselves guilty of trying to talk about the future of Nigeria.
Sowore is our winner, not a criminal-Ondo student
Irinyemi said Sowore's Foundation for Free Literacy, which has helped many parents send their children to school, has been in place since its inception by the DSS.
A school in Ondo State has gone on a protest march for the arrest of a pro-democracy activist, and Sahara Protestant publisher, Omoyele Sowore, by the State Department.
students, according to the Kiribo Students' Union, said Sowore's arrest was to be condemned by Nigerian lovers
The protesters marched on the town of Idepe under the Okitipupa administration of the state, chanting slogans and demanding the release of Sowore, who has provided them with free education for many years to date.
According to the students, the declaration of Sowore and Olawale Bakare as 'prisoners of conscience' by Amnesty International, shows that the internationally-recognized pro-democracy activist is known as one of the few Africans known as activists.
A spokesman for the student protesters, Samuel Irinyemi, told the Sahara Protesters that many of them were beneficiaries of Sowore's free education who were being held hostage.
He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to abide by the court order by ordering security forces to release Sowore to his family.
Irinyemi, "we are just a few of the many students who receive free scholarships from Omoyele Sowore Foundation for Free Education in Ondo State
we are unhappy that our brother and the eldest we are benefiting from is the one who died and was in the hands of the DSS on hate speech.
Sowore is not a criminal because we know his story well.
“This is a man who provided most of the free education at his own expense and also enabled us to get an education.
"I have been benefiting from this grant for almost five years now.
Therefore, we are unhappy with the detention of the detainee even though the court has authorized his release
If the court makes a bold statement about a matter, it should be obeyed.
"If you have a problem or have trouble with confidence, the other thing is to ask for boldness and not to belittle or violate a court order.
"If you are given a court order, but you are careful not to do it because you are the governor, the president or the head of state, then you are laying a bad foundation."
The Nigerian government has refused to release Omoyele Sowore, despite orders from two judges
Sowore was acquitted by the Federal High Court in Abuja by the Department of State in less than 24 hours after being released for 125 days.

SPECIAL COMPLAINT: why the army fell into the hands of the ISWAP
Road works and tours of the 2018 military year, does it work?
Evidence of ISWAP military attacks in 2018 on their territory is 70%.
What this means is that out of 20 military bases, ISWAP has expelled or closed military operations in 14 military bases alone in 2018.
The only time such a figure has occurred in 2018 is in 2014.
by the end of 2015, there had been a 50 per cent victory, which ended in 2016 and 2017, and had its worst in 2018.
With just a few days to go before the evacuation in 2018, protests from the war-torn northeastern Nigerian state have sparked fears of violence in several towns around Maiduguri, Borno state.
Governor Kashim Shettima, at the time, called an emergency meeting of the security forces to get information from the security personnel in the state.
The heads of all departments at the Government House, Maiduguri, on the basis of authority, the situation is tense and tense
In fact, the situation is deteriorating as the Nigerian military, which is being killed by the criminals, Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram, is reluctant to support, and is a militant. wasted a lot of time.
Within two weeks, the Nigerian military had withdrawn its support or been defeated in several battalions.
Of the 20 battlefields in the North and Central Borno under the control of the Nigerian Army, 14 have been evacuated and closed.
Numerous military retreats, suggesting there will be a transition by the military or ignorance of the future?
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for an immediate end to hostilities in Lake Chad Basin.
Two developers explained this.
One threat, meanwhile, is that they have received large sums of money from the government.
In addition, there has been access to military equipment on the battlefield by criminals, to discourage them from fighting. For example, the fall of the International Military Task Force Base, the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, which was overseen by a military commander, who was very vocal, not in the fall of the venue but n 'due to the large number of military equipment only to hand in hand with the existing equipment to the military in Maiduguri to ISWAP.
Criminals are already winning and are motivated in a way that threatens the military.
According to a complaint we received from AFP, there has never been such a riot in the North East that has put the Nigerian military in trouble as it is now in the hands of criminals only in 2018.
As a result of the escalation of the heart attack, Chad Basin's economic restructuring plan provided for fishing, full-time farming, water, land cross-border trade, the criminals remained firm.
it is understood, they have welcomed new troops both English-speaking and French-speaking countries and surrounding countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.
The information coming in from ISWAP indicates a further challenge to the authorities and the military in capturing the country.
ISWAP considers the Northern and Central Borno regions as their own. The Nigerian military presence at the military base has been taken as high as that of those who have been forcibly removed by the military.
Waiting for their time to acquire equipment along with the lifting of their spirits to quell the unrest, the team was willing to spend several years researching before they marched.
Their optimism came true in 2018.
They have been in trouble all year 2018. ISWAP's plan is to make things like military operations in areas they have taken over impossible.
ISWAP has taken the North and Central Borno regions as its own territory and amended them as a law to quell all unrest in the country.
This is despite the fact that politicians and the military are talking about the situation in those areas.
In fact, the Boko Haram / ISWAP rule in the region has changed due to the backlash they had many times during the run-up to Nigeria's 2014 elections.
They no longer wanted to occupy territories as they had hoped, but rather occupied forces outside the region. Going forward, ISWAP strives to make its citizens more secure and secure than the military.
This is their plan.
they have protected the trade routes in their cities.
Lake Chad is a land of its own for farmers and fisheries.
They have severely damaged the fish and onion market in Maiduguri. In its place, they have opened up businesses in commercial countries such as Kinchandi, in the Niger Republic and again in Kusiri, Cameroon.
Nigerian customers are optimistic about the market of Kusiri, Cameroon by Mubi, and Adamawa.
The other is in Kinchandi, Niger Republic.
Named Nigeria in Hadeja, Jigawa state has a strong market presence in the Niger Republic.
Soldiers can take their product from their customers, take away their training and satisfy themselves rather than devising ways to resist their own business.
It now appears that more countries are joining ISWAP than the military.
ISWAP wants to make it less attractive and more expensive by the number of people and the use of equipment that the military will use to protect those cities.
They have calculated and concluded that as they attack the army that will put them back on the ground, which will convince the locals that they will be safer under them than under the Nigerian army.
however, they have decided that they will continue to fight for the army until it is too late for those who have been discouraged to pursue them sooner rather than later.
Road works and tours of the 2018 military year, does it work?
Evidence of ISWAP military attacks in 2018 on their territory is 70%.
What this means is that out of 20 military bases, ISWAP has expelled or closed military operations in 14 military bases alone in 2018.
The only time such a figure has occurred in 2018 is in 2014.
by the end of 2015, there had been a 50 per cent victory, which ended in 2016 and 2017, and had its worst in 2018.
The scene and the map of the aftermath of the terrible war.
The area bordering Mount Borno is under the jurisdiction of Mount Maiduguri and is bordered by three countries including the Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon.
ISWAP has been strong in these countries.
Central Borno has eight sub-districts, but ISWAP and Boko Haram are strongest in these areas.
South Borno is made up of nine sub-states with little influence, with the exception of towns such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok.
With about 45 days to go before the presidential election, it appears that there is a security breach at work to cover up the crisis rather than accept it.
The military has specifically said that ISWAP may but has not captured key operations where it has been strong, especially in the city of Baga.
ISWAP, on the other hand, was right when it said it had chased down militants in areas it had attacked, including Baga.
Neither the military nor the criminals can seize and control the vast land.
But while they do not want to build a tower in the area they like, ISWAP has come a long way for the military to find it.
On the other hand, by claiming that its workers are local, the army has won only by making them ducks and easy enemies to attack.
Clearly, ISWAP is no longer interested in taking over military bases like the one in Baga and staying there. E
the house does not plan them at all.
What impressed them the most was taking weapons in those areas and instilling fear in the troops which made it difficult for the troops to support the fighting.
For example, two days after the attack on Baga, ISWAP fighters left and took their weapons. From a reliable source, their aim is not to seize and take over the army, the ISWAP's favorite is to drive the troops from their positions to the border with Chad.
There is no better indication of the ISWAP's tactics against the military than to ensure that the Nigerian military is in a state of turmoil so that it is unable to carry out its mission. instead, they are in different places waiting for another day of attack.
the problem is the small army there.
For example, in one of the detention centers in Jos, Plateau state, there were more than a dozen military barracks left behind.
Similarly, militants who want to escape are those who have been captured by military equipment in the country.
in the extreme embarrassment of the situation, military leaders are hiding such things.
The soldier in the hospital lamented that the soldiers had been lost.
He said many militants had been killed in action by Boko Haram.
I would count many people who have been bombed by my own generation since they hid their assault.
Police are seeing the same thing so that 120 workers have been ambushed as they hear that they have been taken into custody.
President Ibrahim Idris, according to Premium TImes on December 28, 2018, spoke out against the ban.
"The police are very kind to their superiors for chasing them. We are not fortunate because when we wanted to hide, we were arrested and we were not tried for several months," said one soldier arrested by the Special Task Force. (STF) in Jos.
He was arrested after he and his group slipped forward
A courageous front-runner who spoke to our reporters about their situation praised their troops for their resilience on a number of occasions.
He said that unlike the terrorists, the military does not use video cameras to fight to escape their bullets.
According to him, there were more attacks on military bases by the terrorists than by those in the area.
"Players go to the polls on television, where we, as a rule, do not do this.
"Nevertheless, he urged Nigerians not to pay attention to the number of crimes we have committed. The killings of civilians are in our hearts. troops continue to die, Nigeria may cross, "he concluded
many of the attacks were so great that many military bases were badly damaged.
According to media reports, at least 1,000 soldiers have been killed in 2018.
The death toll does not include those killed in the Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and West Borno.
Of course, there has never been a year in which soldiers were killed as much as in 2018, not in 2013 and 2014 we did not see the kind of massacre we have seen so far, "said a military doctor in Maiduguri.
To make matters worse for the military, through ISWAP, the threat posed by the captives was to teach them how to fight with modern technology before enslaving or killing them.
The official source said that the battlefield in Monguno was the only one operating outside of Maiduguri that had not been harmed.
Four or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, where Damasak is a joint force with the Niger Republic.
as the army chief in the hospital, 'soldiers in those generations have fled and are unable to move or carry out any attacks'.
As workers leave, the military itself has abandoned the notion of 'not backing down, not stopping the fighting'.
A few weeks ago, they closed two military bases in Gudumbali and Kukawa.
"We fled to Monguno before attacking Baga.
Already, many soldiers and people are fleeing Monguno to Maiduguri, "said a soldier at Shagari's affordable housing in Maiduguri.
He said there was no military support.
What is worse is the way ISWAPs try to make sure we know their support for attacks.
"There was no attack that we did not see before, and despite this, we have no help," he said in a loud voice.
In the midst of this retreat, the troops were fed up during the fighting.
On December 28, 2018, the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of the International Defense Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) in the United States declared the in the North (Eastern part of Nigeria) which is based on military coup and (President) Buhari - surrounded by his party - did not fight the crisis.
"ISSA, a non-governmental organization based in Washington that has jurisdiction over international security, says the crimes against President Muhammadu Buhari's military junta are the reason why Nigeria is falling apart. war against Boko Haram.
By the way, the only viable option the Nigerian military is fighting is 'to stop the spread of crime, which amounts to billions of dollars, to buy supplies for military commanders and military supplies.'
more than anything, it has been discovered that Lake Chad militants and the country’s customers are under ISWAP trying to get the evicted people back home.
but, for others, it was a war and many times, won by the military which made many want to enter.
The newcomer and Frenchman said "the word progress of ISWAP means only one thing, Allah is with us."
Another who left his family's big business in Kano to be a fighter said, "I have no doubt that an angelic life will be with us in this fight, otherwise, nothing else can explain our victory."
In these events, is the Nigerian military moving forward with an intelligence system that will lead to a disgraceful fall?
For a government that has boasted of how to counter terrorism, so far, it has become very serious.
Efforts by independent researchers to determine the scope of intellectual property have become unacceptable.
Local and international officials and journalists have, as a result, been attacked by the military.
As a result of military action and human rights abuses, including rape, extrajudicial and extrajudicial killings, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other human rights groups are set to prosecute.
Despite the international media coverage of the Nigerian crisis, the well-known Global Terrorism Index in 2018 ranked Nigeria as the third country in terms of terrorism, but the military and government have made it clear that they do not care.
The show portrayed Nigeria as a war-torn country like Iraq, Afghanistan and across Syria and Pakistan.
However, complaints show that 16 per cent of deaths fell through threats in 2017 last year.
In addition, the World Economic Forum, on a two-year tour of health and safety concerns, said Nigeria was one of the worst countries in the world.
Amid the sadness of the media, the Nigerian military called for an end to the killings and for Boko Haram to stop the killings, instead of preventing the killings in the first place, so that they would not have a message of genocide. spread

SSS is a real hater, by Stanley Imhanruor
Given the stupidity and inaccuracies of the SSS which are acquired by the media, it is necessary to add a lot of photos and videos circulating on social media
I have read with laughter, a list of journalists from the SSS where the shameless workers denied that they did not want to reintroduce Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare in court
Given the stupidity and inaccuracies of the SSS which are acquired by the media, it is necessary to add a lot of photos and videos circulating on social media
In the popular image, the person wearing Sowore's southern shirt (the man who later sat under Sowore, wearing a white shirt and black jacket is an employee of the SSS.
Everyone will see through the popular image and when the seed worker gets up, people ask him: who are you? who are you? but the user did not answer
The user is also the subject of a photo that is popping up all over the social media platform
The employee is already around Sowore in court and he is the one authorized by the SSS staff to join Sowore in court to know his whereabouts and actions whenever the matter arises in court where other employees are at a distance. ekiri
To be clear, the name of the user is Dekko Nelly (Mashal)
Please do not be fooled by SSS complaints as this is a futile attempt to cover up their misconduct in the eyes of local and international actors regarding the situation.
Regardless of the extent to which the hatred has spread, the fact that it is eternal and uninspired must mean something in the future.
Stop attacking too many stores in Nigeria.
It is owned by Nigerians - Expert warns
He said MTN, a public utility company, however, many Nigerians had a stake in the company which was also involved in the accident and damaging its infrastructure.
Rotimi Sankore, a talented journalist, legal and development expert, has warned of shoplifting, security breaches, which are said to be due to the ongoing war in West Africa.
Sankore, who spoke at the Civic Media Lab Press Conference, said the licensed shops are owned by Nigerians.
The size of the store is authorized. most of the goods seized are owned by Nigerians. Their staff is Nigerian, he said
He said MTN, which has been targeted by the public, was a public company, however, many Nigerians had a stake in the company which was responsible for the damage and damages its infrastructure.
He said the war of hatred was the result of high unemployment and high crime, not that all West Africans hated Nigerians.
The wise journalist also discusses how the Nigerian government could have waged a war of attrition against its subjects.
In the event of such an attack on Nigerians, all you have to do is call their Deputies and demand that the perpetrators be punished and that the victims be subjected to torture.
Next is to bring the police to guard the Nigerian citizen market for future attacks.
This will make the offenders unacceptable for their actions.
If they do not do anything, send the representative home. If the attack continues, you will do something about it. heart
Sankore said it was because the Nigerian government had not done enough to protect its subjects that Nigerians had become insecure and many had stolen from the road.

received and learning-learning from Olamilekan, 11-year-old Macron's new friend by Mide Ayeni
You see, Olemilekan has a mother who sees the future.
He had understanding of success. Despite his poverty, he was not blind. Olemilekan said: “When I was six years old, I started painting.
My mother found it and took me to an artist to study under it ".
Initially, he understood the concept of recruiting, training, correction and effort.
She loves her son who loves painting and decides to buy the collection by sending it to the artist, who will raise and train him to paint the collection.
I will tell you a story about the collection and the wrestling. Which will come first?
It will take longer to read
First of all, I would like to make my point all the time, that in the next 'twenty years', 'pregnant women' will produce better people than 'good gods'
This afternoon my husband and I had a discussion about Olamilekan, a 12-year-old boy who saw the French President and drew his picture in less than two hours.
Well, let me explain.
In the speech of the African Idol, where the French President went yesterday, the boy went to work and took out a beautiful painting of Macron.
This surprised the President so much that he said "This is Special".
Let's talk about Olamilekan
He came from a poor family. Loss of pregnancy.
For many of us who see ourselves as minors, Olamilekan sees himself as a good god.
He was very poor and he said: "In his family, they have to work hard and fast before they get the food they need."
So he paints a picture of a fast-paced boy putting food on his desk.
Olamilekan was heartbroken when he spoke to the BBC about the tattoo work that was found to be tearful in his speech.
He called it real
He was 11 years old and he understood poverty so much that he could not take his pictures.
So you need to know where it comes from
Second, if you see a house where you were interviewed by Olamilekan, you will understand his roots - his life and his story.
I approached when I first saw the interview and got a picture of my son.
You must acknowledge that I have posted his images here more than twice. It touched my heart
And let me tell you a secret most people do not know
You see, Olemilekan has a mother who sees the future. He had understanding of success.
Despite his poverty, he was not blind.
Olemilekan said: “When I was six years old, I started painting.
My mother found it and took me to an artist to study under it. "
Initially, he understood the concept of recruiting, training, correction and effort.
She loves her son who loves painting and decides to buy the collection by sending it to the artist, who will raise and train him to paint the collection.
This is not what his mother did at Harvard. in fact, most educated parents do not.
they only know the education so they put their children in expensive schools and pay them to get tuition during the holidays, especially the coming tam end and give them a paper in their brain without giving them a chance. discover their talents. Everyone in the world has access to it and most of them will lose it without proper training.
The other thing is, he understood the Onatarachi process before the Effort. let me tell you another story.
Do you remember Olajumoke and 'Taju went to school' well?
It's good.
Olajumoke became famous for his photo editing and size-reaching style.
However, Olajumoke, in spite of his best efforts, was not without its challenges.
He is doing well and trying hard but what is the catch? what does it take to maintain that greatness?
You will see that since Olamilekan was raised, Olajumoke was not lifted.
Olajumoke is popular on Nigeria's airwaves and media but Olamilekan has received international acclaim through the media.
One of his images was viewed by more than 4.5 million people. It gave me joy.
I scream and show my wife the mark.
After an interview with BBC Africa, the BBC World Service showed him and Aljazeera, who did not want to show what the BBC had shown, came to interview him.
You will see what a receiver can do.
It's like telling Olajumoke to go back and fix a photo.
It is impossible.
But by default, you get 'back to full-time jobs'
The Bible says that "the gift of man has dominated man to his injury and has made him stand before kings and not before mortal men."
I also tell my husband that he received it before the effort.
Only when you are fully aware of your limitations will you begin to apply them
Trying has its own car but most of the time, it does not arrive on time but the receipt is the world to watch.
Injuries elevate a person.
Talk about Ronaldo or Serana Williams and the audience around us
I'm going to stress it out, parents have a role to play. Olamilekan may or may not be the most educated person in his class.
He may or may not go to a private school as we know it, but he has a mother who knows what greatness is, and I tell you, greatness is not about money or books but about the glory of everyone's wisdom. .
The day we realize we must first find out what God has given us and how we can train Him, then we stop being on earth and start living.
The Olamilekan story will no longer be the same as before.
He said, "I want to be like Michelangelo. I said" Tosin, how do you know this guy?
When you look at it, who told you about the story of this great artist?
Who do your children want you to be like?
What kind of people do children live like?
Who are they? What story are you telling them?
Do you think that if her mother had told her about the Assassin Queen, she would have known Michelangelo?
What do you say in your children's ears?
Holidays are coming, many are thinking of sending their children to another school. Many think of something else.
What do you think? What on earth do you think you are?
I have said it a million times, in twenty years we will see a repayment of what we have sown

Does any of you who read this article remember Barack Obama, a two-time winner who spent eight years in the White House without any criminal record, being described as a nine-year-old cat?
Not by long bullets.
The answer to an unanswered question is a resounding Yes.
Poor Obama as President of the United States of America sara.
You would have thought they would have released him when he came to power, but his administration and White House officials did not release him even for a short time.
In fact, the idiot who knows nothing about the White House is still looking for a way to blame Obama or Hillary, even for his stupidity that he thinks he is the most intelligent President in the United States.

The call of the people to the department of civil servants to be removed by the actions of the Legislature and the media from large to small, reorganized, reorganized into the ranks of the armed forces such as the Nigerian Police The wounds of this country cannot be cured by the harassment inflicted on them by intelligence agents in a defunct state of Nigeria.
What is the best way to describe a secret act or act that threatens the country, the law and the legislature, democracy and the way it acts?
who needs a modern safety net, a unique way of collecting intelligence, and does not know anything about modern methods to obtain the truth and lack of knowledge on how to prevent a terrorist threat?
The DSS needs an internal cleanup and should be expedited.
Someone like Peter AFunanya, a spokesman, should be thrown out for embarrassing a racist group that knows nothing about intelligence gathering, just roaming around like a dog fighting against the president.
The difficult question to ask is why did this bad government resort to hate speech against the rulers when the real enemy of the state is the bloodthirsty government?
I have worked in the past to educate the DSS and its sponsors that the security name given to them is 'national security'.
Its real name is 'modern security' which is covered as 'national security' to steal people and make criminals ignorant and trapped.
People will not be ruled out by secret intelligence groups that do not adhere to the rules that do not differentiate between Boko Haram and local social changers.
Sadly, Peter Afunanya is the DSS's defamation agent for his stupidity and the hatred he has inflicted on a separate video showing abuse of the court of law in the Federal High Court, in Abuja, n ‘Friday by the DSS.
Afunanya can not hide the fact that accepting a murderer's money is different from hiding a media show.
Cannot explain why DSS arrested Omoyele Sowore less than 24 hours after his release
As a bird's-eye viewer, Afunanya buried her head and the DSS in the sand without saying a word about the journalist and shooter of the human rights group who died in Bezarre.
Afunanya spoke half-truth in a secret joke for shameless and unprofessional conduct, as an embarrassing display of power at the table among the insecure public.
What good is a web site if it simply "blends in" with everything else out there?
What is the role of the DSS when members of a secret group commit suicide and cause chaos in this country every day?
Why did the DSS look into the Legislature and the legislature, and eliminate the error of intelligence, order and error in an orderly manner.
The time has come for the House of Representatives to look into the law that created the DSS for the happiness of Nigerians.
The DSS needs to be overhauled or completely dismantled and removed from being a small department under the president or people in positions of power.
If not, Nigerians will wake up one day and hear that the criminal has built his own court (DSS) to undermine Nigerians, democracy and civil development.

Sowore: The invasion of the Court, The implications of the collapse of democracy we have seen these scenes come to the fore several years ago, not a few months ago and give us great interest.
It has literally meant something
Omoyele Sowore
BBC
The President of the African Democratic Congress, Ralph Nwosu, has slammed the fruits of his democratic rhetoric and journalist, Omoyele Sowore, and described it as a result of the collapse of his democracy.
Sowore was arraigned by the State Department of Justice at the Federal High Court last Friday, less than 24 hours after his release.
The practice has been criticized by local and international authorities but the Nigerian government says it is not affected.
In an interview with PUNCH, Nwosu said, "what happened in court was a clear indication of the failure of democracy.
They have seen the show that has been coming to us for many years, not just a few months ago and is of great interest to us. it has come out in full.
When dictatorships begin, there will be many subtleties to guide the people, but when they come to fruition, problems arise.
In a speech on Tuesday, Banky-W described Nigeria as a country proud of torturing innocent people.
He said, "I am only grateful for the way our court has acted properly by releasing Omoyele Sowore.
Nigeria has a way of punishing the innocent and destroying the power, the will and the hope of the people,
Every time our leaders do wrong and pass away, our hearts go out to them
we are helpless, hopeless, we accept that it is so unknown, but there is nothing we can say or do to change it
"You do not have to be a candidate or a volunteer for Sowore to ensure that human rights and justice are not compromised.
The right to free speech and the right to freedom of movement are the fundamental rights of every Nigerian
May God bless all those in our legislature who are on the right side of the story by doing good
May God encourage, comfort and bless Sowore, his wife and his family as they go through these bad days only to find themselves guilty of trying to talk about the future of Nigeria.
Sowore is our winner, not a criminal-Ondo student
Irinyemi said Sowore's Foundation for Free Literacy, which has helped many parents send their children to school, has been in place since its inception by the DSS.
A school in Ondo State has gone on a protest march for the arrest of a pro-democracy activist, and Sahara Protestant publisher, Omoyele Sowore, by the State Department.
students, according to the Kiribo Students' Union, said Sowore's arrest was to be condemned by Nigerian lovers
The protesters marched on the town of Idepe under the Okitipupa administration of the state, chanting slogans and demanding the release of Sowore, who has provided them with free education for many years to date.
According to the students, the declaration of Sowore and Olawale Bakare as 'prisoners of conscience' by Amnesty International, shows that the internationally-recognized pro-democracy activist is known as one of the few Africans known as activists.
A spokesman for the student protesters, Samuel Irinyemi, told the Sahara Protesters that many of them were beneficiaries of Sowore's free education who were being held hostage.
He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to abide by the court order by ordering security forces to release Sowore to his family.
Irinyemi, "we are just a few of the many students who receive free scholarships from Omoyele Sowore Foundation for Free Education in Ondo State
we are unhappy that our brother and the eldest we are benefiting from is the one who died and was in the hands of the DSS on hate speech.
Sowore is not a criminal because we know his story well.
“This is a man who provided most of the free education at his own expense and also enabled us to get an education.
"I have been benefiting from this grant for almost five years now.
Therefore, we are unhappy with the detention of the detainee even though the court has authorized his release
If the court makes a bold statement about a matter, it should be obeyed.
"If you have a problem or have trouble with confidence, the other thing is to ask for boldness and not to belittle or violate a court order.
"If you are given a court order, but you are careful not to do it because you are the governor, the president or the head of state, then you are laying a bad foundation."
The Nigerian government has refused to release Omoyele Sowore, despite orders from two judges
Sowore was acquitted by the Federal High Court in Abuja by the Department of State in less than 24 hours after being released for 125 days.

SPECIAL COMPLAINT: why the army fell into the hands of the ISWAP
Road works and tours of the 2018 military year, does it work?
Evidence of ISWAP military attacks in 2018 on their territory is 70%.
What this means is that out of 20 military bases, ISWAP has expelled or closed military operations in 14 military bases alone in 2018.
The only time such a figure has occurred in 2018 is in 2014.
by the end of 2015, there had been a 50 per cent victory, which ended in 2016 and 2017, and had its worst in 2018.
With just a few days to go before the evacuation in 2018, protests from the war-torn northeastern Nigerian state have sparked fears of violence in several towns around Maiduguri, Borno state.
Governor Kashim Shettima, at the time, called an emergency meeting of the security forces to get information from the security personnel in the state.
The heads of all departments at the Government House, Maiduguri, on the basis of authority, the situation is tense and tense
In fact, the situation is deteriorating as the Nigerian military, which is being killed by the criminals, Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram, is reluctant to support, and is a militant. wasted a lot of time.
Within two weeks, the Nigerian military had withdrawn its support or been defeated in several battalions.
Of the 20 battleships in the North and Central Borno under the control of the Nigerian Army, 14 have been liberated and closed.
Numerous military retreats, suggesting there will be a transition by the military or ignorance of the future?
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for an immediate end to hostilities in Lake Chad Basin.
Two developers explained this.
One threat, meanwhile, is that they have received large sums of money from the government.
In addition, there has been access to military equipment on the battlefield by criminals, to discourage them from fighting.
For example, the fall of the International Military Task Force Base, the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, which was overseen by a military commander, who was very vocal, not in the fall of the venue but n 'due to the large number of military equipment only to hand in hand with the existing equipment to the military in Maiduguri to ISWAP.
Criminals are already winning and are motivated in a way that threatens the military.
According to a complaint we received from AFP, there has never been such a riot in the North East that has put the Nigerian military in trouble as it is now in the hands of criminals only in 2018.
As a result of the escalation of the heart attack, Chad Basin's economic restructuring plan provided for fishing, full-time farming, water, land cross-border trade, the criminals remained firm.
it is understood, they have welcomed new troops both English-speaking and French-speaking countries and surrounding countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.
The information coming in from ISWAP indicates a further challenge to the authorities and the military in capturing the country.
ISWAP considers the Northern and Central Borno regions as their own.
The Nigerian military presence at the military base has been taken as high as that of those who have been forcibly removed by the military.
Waiting for their time to acquire equipment along with the lifting of their spirits to quell the unrest, the team was willing to spend several years researching before they marched.
Their optimism came true in 2018.
They have been in trouble all year 2018.
ISWAP's plan is to make things like military operations in areas they have taken over impossible.
ISWAP has taken the North and Central Borno regions as its own territory and amended them as a law to quell all unrest in the country.
This is despite the fact that politicians and the military are talking about the situation in those areas.
In fact, the Boko Haram / ISWAP rule in the region has changed due to the backlash they had many times during the run-up to Nigeria's 2014 elections.
They no longer wanted to occupy territories as they had hoped, but rather occupied forces outside the region.
Going forward, ISWAP strives to make its citizens more secure and secure than the military. This is their plan.
they have protected the trade routes in their cities.
Lake Chad is a land of its own for farmers and fisheries.
They have severely damaged the fish and onion market in Maiduguri.
In its place, they have opened up businesses in commercial countries such as Kinchandi, in the Niger Republic and again in Kusiri, Cameroon.
Nigerian customers are optimistic about the market of Kusiri, Cameroon by Mubi, and Adamawa. The other is in Kinchandi, Niger Republic.
Named Nigeria in Hadeja, Jigawa state has a strong market presence in the Niger Republic.
Soldiers can take their product from their customers, take away their training and satisfy themselves rather than devising ways to resist their own business.
It now appears that more countries are joining ISWAP than the military.
ISWAP wants to make it less attractive and more expensive by the number of people and the use of equipment that the military will use to protect those cities.
They have calculated and concluded that as they attack the army that will put them back on the ground, which will convince the locals that they will be safer under them than under the Nigerian army.
however, they have decided that they will continue to fight for the army until it is too late for those who have been discouraged to pursue them sooner rather than later.
Road works and tours of the 2018 military year, does it work?
Evidence of ISWAP military attacks in 2018 on their territory is 70%.
What this means is that out of 20 military bases, ISWAP has expelled or closed military operations in 14 military bases alone in 2018.
The only time such a figure has occurred in 2018 is in 2014.
by the end of 2015, there had been a 50 per cent victory, which ended in 2016 and 2017, and had its worst in 2018.
The scene and the map of the aftermath of the terrible war. The area bordering Mount Borno is under the jurisdiction of Mount Maiduguri and is bordered by three countries including the Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon.
ISWAP has been strong in these countries.
Central Borno has eight sub-districts, but ISWAP and Boko Haram are strongest in these areas.
South Borno is made up of nine sub-states with little influence, with the exception of towns such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok.
With about 45 days to go before the presidential election, it appears that there is a security breach at work to cover up the crisis rather than accept it.
The military has specifically said that ISWAP may but has not captured key operations where it has been strong, especially in the city of Baga.
ISWAP, on the other hand, was right when it said it had chased down militants in areas it had attacked, including Baga.
Neither the military nor the criminals can seize and control the vast land. But while they do not want to build a tower in the area they like, ISWAP has come a long way for the military to find it.
On the other hand, by claiming that its workers are local, the army has won only by making them ducks and easy enemies to attack.
Clearly, ISWAP is no longer interested in taking over military bases like the one in Baga and staying there.
The place never planned for them.
What impressed them the most was taking weapons in those areas and instilling fear in the troops which made it difficult for the troops to support the fighting.
For example, two days after the attack on Baga, ISWAP fighters left and took their weapons.
From a reliable source, their aim is not to seize and take over the army, the ISWAP's favorite is to drive the troops from their positions to the border with Chad.
There is no better indication of the ISWAP's tactics against the military than to ensure that the Nigerian military is in a state of turmoil so that it is unable to carry out its mission.
instead, they are in different places waiting for another day of attack.
the problem is the small army there.
For example, in one of the detention centers in Jos, Plateau state, there were more than a dozen military barracks left behind.
Similarly, militants who want to escape are those who have been captured by military equipment in the country. in the extreme embarrassment of the situation, military leaders are hiding such things.
The soldier in the hospital lamented that the soldiers had been lost.
He said many militants had been killed in action by Boko Haram.
I would count many people who have been bombed by my own generation since they hid their assault.
Police are seeing the same thing so that 120 workers have been ambushed as they hear that they have been taken into custody.
President Ibrahim Idris, according to Premium TImes on December 28, 2018, spoke out against the ban.
"The police are very kind to their superiors for chasing them. We are not fortunate because when we wanted to hide, we were arrested and we were not tried for several months," said one soldier arrested by the Special Task Force. (STF) in Jos. He was arrested after he and his group slipped forward
A courageous front-runner who spoke to our reporters about their situation praised their troops for their resilience on a number of occasions.
He said that unlike the terrorists, the military does not use video cameras to fight to escape their bullets.
According to him, there were more attacks on military bases by the terrorists than by those in the area.
"Players go to the polls on television, where we, as a rule, do not do this."
In any case, he urged Nigerians not to pay attention to the number of crimes we have committed, the killings of civilians are in our hearts, what this means is, if the people war continues to die, Nigeria may pass, "he concluded
many of the attacks were so great that many military bases were badly damaged.
According to media reports, at least 1,000 soldiers have been killed in 2018.
The death toll does not include those killed in the Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and West Borno.
Of course, there has never been a year in which soldiers were killed as much as in 2018, not in 2013 and 2014 we did not see the kind of massacre we have seen so far, "said a military doctor in Maiduguri.
To make matters worse for the military, through ISWAP, the threat posed by the captives was to teach them how to fight with modern technology before enslaving or killing them.
The official source said that the battlefield in Monguno was the only one operating outside of Maiduguri that had not been harmed.
Four or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, where Damasak is a joint force with the Niger Republic.
as the army chief in the hospital, 'soldiers in those generations have fled and are unable to move or carry out any attacks'.
As workers leave, the military itself has abandoned the notion of 'not backing down, not stopping the fighting'.
A few weeks ago, they closed two military bases in Gudumbali and Kukawa.
"We fled to Monguno before attacking Baga.
Already, many soldiers and people are fleeing Monguno to Maiduguri, "said a soldier at Shagari's affordable housing in Maiduguri.
He said there was no military support.
What is worse is the way ISWAPs try to make sure we know their support for attacks.
"There was no attack that we did not see before, and despite this, we have no help," he said in a loud voice.
In the midst of this retreat, the troops were fed up during the fighting.
On December 28, 2018, the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of the International Defense Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) in the United States declared the in the north (eastern part of Nigeria) which is based on military alliances and (President) Buhari - who is surrounded by his party - did not fight the crisis. "
ISSA, a Washington-based non-governmental organization that has international authority over national security, says crimes against President Muhammadu Buhari's military junta are the cause of Nigeria's war. against Boko Haram.
By the way, the only viable option the Nigerian military is fighting is 'to stop the spread of crime, which amounts to billions of dollars, to buy supplies for military commanders and military supplies.'
more than anything, it has been discovered that Lake Chad militants and the country’s customers are under ISWAP trying to get the evicted people back home.
but, for others, it was a war and many times, won by the military which made many want to enter.
The newcomer and Frenchman said "the word progress of ISWAP means only one thing, Allah is with us."
Another who left his family's big business in Kano to be a fighter said, "I have no doubt that an angelic life will be with us in this fight, otherwise, nothing else can explain our victory."
In these events, is the Nigerian military moving forward with an intelligence system that will lead to a disgraceful fall?
For a government that has boasted of how to counter terrorism, so far, it has become very serious.
Efforts by independent researchers to determine the scope of intellectual property have become unacceptable. Local and international officials and journalists have, as a result, been attacked by the military.
As a result of military action and human rights abuses, including rape, extrajudicial and extrajudicial killings, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other human rights groups are set to prosecute.
Despite the international media coverage of the Nigerian crisis, the well-known Global Terrorism Index in 2018 ranked Nigeria as the third country in terms of terrorism, but the military and government have made it clear that they do not care.
The show portrayed Nigeria as a war-torn country like Iraq, Afghanistan and across Syria and Pakistan.
However, complaints show that 16 per cent of deaths fell through threats in 2017 last year.
In addition, the World Economic Forum, on a two-year tour of health and safety concerns, said Nigeria was one of the worst countries in the world.
Amid the sadness of the media, the Nigerian military called for an end to the killings and for Boko Haram to stop the killings, instead of preventing the killings in the first place, so that they would not have a message of genocide. spread

SSS is a real hater, by Stanley Imhanruor
Given the stupidity and inaccuracies of the SSS which are acquired by the media, it is necessary to add a lot of photos and videos circulating on social media
I have read with laughter, a list of journalists from the SSS where the shameless workers denied that they did not want to reintroduce Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare in court
Given the stupidity and inaccuracies of the SSS which are acquired by the media, it is necessary to add a lot of photos and videos circulating on social media
In the popular image, the person wearing Sowore's southern shirt (the man who later sat under Sowore, wearing a white shirt and black jacket is an employee of the SSS.
Everyone will see through the popular image and when the seed worker gets up, people ask him: who are you? who are you? but the user did not answer
The user is also the subject of a photo that is popping up all over the social media platform
The employee is already around Sowore in court and he is the one authorized by the SSS staff to join Sowore in court to know his whereabouts and actions whenever the matter arises in court where other employees are at a distance. ekiri
To be clear, the name of the user is Dekko Nelly (Mashal)
Please do not be fooled by SSS complaints as this is a futile attempt to cover up their misconduct in the eyes of local and international actors regarding the situation.
Regardless of the extent to which the hatred has spread, the fact that it is eternal and uninspired must mean something in the future.
Stop attacking too many stores in Nigeria.
It is owned by Nigerians - Expert warns
He said MTN, a public utility company, however, many Nigerians had a stake in the company which was also involved in the accident and damaging its infrastructure.
Rotimi Sankore, a talented journalist, legal and development expert, has warned of shoplifting, security breaches, which are said to be due to the ongoing war in West Africa.
Sankore, who spoke at the Civic Media Lab Press Conference, said the licensed shops are owned by Nigerians.
The size of the store is authorized. most of the goods seized are owned by Nigerians. Their staff is Nigerian, he said
He said MTN, which has been targeted by the public, was a public company, however, many Nigerians had a stake in the company which was responsible for the damage and damages its infrastructure.
He said the war of hatred was the result of high unemployment and high crime, not that all West Africans hated Nigerians.
The wise journalist also discusses how the Nigerian government could have waged a war of attrition against its subjects.
In the event of such an attack on Nigerians, all you have to do is call their Deputies and demand that the perpetrators be punished and that the victims be subjected to torture.
Next is to bring the police to guard the Nigerian citizen market for future attacks. This will make the offenders unacceptable for their actions.
If they do not do anything, send the representative home. If the attack continues, you will do something about it. heart
Sankore said it was because the Nigerian government had not done enough to protect its subjects that Nigerians had become insecure and many had stolen from the road.

received and learning-learning from Olamilekan, 11-year-old Macron's new friend by Mide Ayeni
You see, Olemilekan has a mother who sees the future.
He had understanding of success.
Despite his poverty, he was not blind.
Olemilekan said: “When I was six years old, I started painting.
My mother found it and took me to an artist to study under it ".
Initially, he understood the concept of recruiting, training, correction and effort.
She loves her son who loves painting and decides to buy the collection by sending it to the artist, who will raise and train him to paint the collection.
I will tell you a story about the collection and the wrestling. Which will come first?
It will take longer to read
First of all, I would like to make my point all the time, that in the next 'twenty years', 'pregnant women' will produce better people than 'good gods'
This afternoon my husband and I had a discussion about Olamilekan, a 12-year-old boy who saw the French President and drew his picture in less than two hours.
Well, let me explain. In the speech of the African Idol, where the French President went yesterday, the boy went to work and took out a beautiful painting of Macron.
This surprised the President so much that he said "This is Special".
Let's talk about Olamilekan
He came from a poor family.
Loss of pregnancy. For many of us who see ourselves as minors, Olamilekan sees himself as a good god.
He was very poor and he said: "In his family, they have to work hard and fast before they get the food they need."
So he paints a picture of a fast-paced boy putting food on his desk.
Olamilekan was heartbroken when he spoke to the BBC about the tattoo work that was found to be tearful in his speech.
He called it real
He was 11 years old and he understood poverty so much that he could not take his pictures.
So you need to know where it comes from
Second, if you see a house where you were interviewed by Olamilekan, you will understand his roots - his life and his story.
I approached when I first saw the interview and got a picture of my son.
You must acknowledge that I have posted his images here more than twice. It touched my heart
And let me tell you a secret most people do not know
You see, Olemilekan has a mother who sees the future.
He had understanding of success. Despite his poverty, he was not blind.
Olemilekan said: "When I was six years old, I started painting. My mother found it and sent me to an artist to study under it."
Initially, he understood the concept of recruiting, training, correction and effort.
She loves her son who loves painting and decides to buy the collection by sending it to the artist, who will raise and train him to paint the collection.
This is not what his mother did at Harvard. in fact, most educated parents do not.
they only know the education so they put their children in expensive schools and pay them to get tuition during the holidays, especially the coming tam end and give them a paper in their brain without giving them a chance. discover their talents.
Everyone in the world has access to it and most of them will lose it without proper training.
The other thing is, he understood the Onatarachi process before the Effort. let me tell you another story.
Do you remember Olajumoke and 'Taju went to school' well? It's good. Olajumoke became famous for his photo editing and size-reaching style.
However, Olajumoke, in spite of his best efforts, was not without its challenges.
He is doing well and trying hard but what is the catch?
what does it take to maintain that greatness?
You will see that since Olamilekan was raised, Olajumoke was not lifted.
Olajumoke is popular on Nigeria's airwaves and media but Olamilekan has received international acclaim through the media.
One of his images was viewed by more than 4.5 million people. It gave me joy. I scream and show my wife the mark.
After an interview with BBC Africa, the BBC World Service showed him and Aljazeera, who did not want to show what the BBC had shown, came to interview him.
You will see what a receiver can do.
It's like telling Olajumoke to go back and fix a photo.
It is impossible. But by default, you get 'back to full-time jobs'
The Bible says that "the gift of man has dominated man to his injury and has made him stand before kings and not before mortal men."
I also tell my husband that he received it before the effort.
 Only when you are fully aware of your limitations will you begin to apply them
Trying has its own car but most of the time, it does not arrive on time but the receipt is the world to watch.
Injuries elevate a person. Talk about Ronaldo or Serana Williams and the audience around us
I'm going to stress it out, parents have a role to play.
Olamilekan may or may not be the most educated person in his class.
He may or may not go to a private school as we know it, but he has a mother who knows what greatness is, and I tell you, greatness is not about money or books but about the glory of everyone's wisdom. .
The day we realize we must first find out what God has given us and how we can train Him, then we stop being on earth and start living.
The Olamilekan story will no longer be the same as before. He said, "I want to be like Michelangelo. I said" Tosin, how do you know this guy?
When you look at it, who told you about the story of this great artist?
Who do your children want you to be like? What kind of people do children live like?
Who are they?
What story are you telling them?
Do you think that if her mother had told her about the Assassin Queen, she would have known Michelangelo?
What do you say in your children's ears?
Holidays are coming, many are thinking of sending their children to another school. Many think of something else.
What do you think?
What on earth do you think you are?
I have said it a million times, in twenty years we will see a repayment of what we have sown

You would have thought they would have released him when he came to power, but his administration and White House officials did not release him even for a short time.
In fact, the idiot who knows nothing about the White House is still looking for a way to blame Obama or Hillary, even for his stupidity that he thinks he is the most intelligent President in the United States.

Oscars 2018: Between Africa and Nigeria 
BBC found out that despite that some Nigeria movie producers feature Hollywood stars in their movies, it has not made them to be among those named for winning any award in Hollywood. 
Nollywood are those responsible for producing movies in Nigeria and other known African countries. Other African countries have shown them superiority. 
Lupita Nyong'o, an American based Kenyan won the award of 'best woman producer' in the year 2013.
Few years ago Nigeria was seen as the hero of movie production in Africa but now, it seems others have surpassed them.
While Nollywood themselves who are in second position in movie production produce over 1000 movies in one year, Hollywood produce less than that number of movies but it does not stop them from being those whom the whole world look up to as the producers of best movies.
In Africa Kenya and South Africa exhibit superiority over Nigeria with regard to winning Oscars award.

The youths engage in masquerading. 
Masquerading is one the culture the Igbos are known for.
Group of masquerades who were celebrating the feast of 'Uzo Iyi' at Uke in Idemili North Local Government Area, Anambra state, attacked a Catholic prayer group and destroyed more than thirty vehicles, injured many people. One of the stabbed persons died on Saturday. 
The priest in charge of the Catholic prayer group Father Emmanuel Obimma, popularly known as Ebube Muonso, and other priests and ordained women escaped from the youths that attacked those who came to worship God with a vigil from Friday night through to Saturday morning. 
The assistant priest Francis Okoye told BBC on phone that the masqueraders attacked the vigil mass by 8pm at night and injured some members of the congregation and destroyed more than thirty vehicles. 
Àgùlerì and Igboukwu are not the ancestral home of the Igbos.
A man has killed his children in Awada.
After the attack we counted the vehicles they destroyed and they were thirty in number.
They injured so many people.
They stabbed one person who was taken the hospital with a knife.
We don't know yet whether the person is alive or dead. 
It is clear that the youths of Uke who did the thing were prepared to persecute the congregation members because when Uzo Iyi is being celebrated, masquerading stops at 6pm but those masquerades attacked the adoration ground by passed 8pm.
They started from beating commercial drivers who were conveying people to church, and collecting their money and their phones. 
Masquerades destroyed many vehicles in the adoration ground. 
Our security operatives did their best to stop them from destroying things but when we saw that what they were doing has gone out of control, we called on the police.

Those who were present at the scene confirmed that the youths of the village were persecuting commercial drivers and the congregation, collecting money, phones and other valuables from them.
Not long ago, they beat Father Obimma's worker that made the priest to complain to police who arrested the youths of the village, although they were released when the King and the elders of the village intervened. 
An allegation was made that the youths always attack the commercial drivers that convey people to the church.

Prominent Igbos have said that Igbos will not support Buhari in 2019 like they did in 2015.
They made the Igbos to understand that it is an empty promise that Igbos will get presidency in 2023 if they support president Buhari to win again in 2019.
Not long ago, some members of APC which include the Minister of Transport , Rotimi Amechi, Secretary to the state government, Boss Mustapha and the Chairman of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, told the Igbos to vote for Buhari in 2019 in order to get their own share in www.

I don't think we should be begging people for presidency.
My view is that we should go and ask God, who knows that if an Igbo emerges as the president that the Fulani, the Yoruba and the different parts of Nigeria will be satisfied because we will restructure the treasury of Nigeria for progress
Talking of 2023 is irrelevant, whoever does that is up to deceiving the Igbos.
On the same hand, the former president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dozie Ikedife, said that the Igbos who were promised presidency did not participate the last time.
He told Sun Newspaper 'The Igbos were promised the same way in the past, we were equally deceived. 
If someone deceived you two or three times, once he comes the fourth time, you have to think deeply. 
One is tired of this nation.
Ikedife equally added: 'My interest is how Biafra will be actualized through lawful procedure anddialogue.
Recall that in 2015, majority of the Igbos did not vote for Buhari in the election which made him say that he would not treat those who gave him 95% support and those who gave him 5% support the same way, a statement many thought he has fulfilled through his appointments since he assumed leadership.

The Nobel Prize winner Soyinka has said that Nigeria is devoid of good leadership.
Wole Soyinka has advised Nigerians 
Wole Soyinka, a well known writer, has advised Nigerians to be at alert and not to allow politicians deceive them in the forthcoming 2019 election.
Soyinka, who said this on Sunday in the posthumous birthday ceremony of a well acclaimed lawyer Gani Fawehinmi which took place in Lagos said that democracy is in danger in Nigeria. 
He said that those who put Nigeria in her present situation through their policies have again presented themselves as messiah because election is forthcoming, and advised Nigerians to reject old politicians in order to give new age politicians the opportunity to take over power.
Buhari and APC leaders have had discussion. 
Wole Soyinka: Comport yourselves and allow an elder to rest.
He said: 'It is not in doubt that democracy is in danger.'
It is not only democracy, our country is in trouble. 
I don't think that there was a time in the entire world, most especially in this nation, a time where protection of everything is soured like this.
We all know this.
The question is whether we are seeing it as a redeeming opportunity or are we seeing it as an opportunity to keep doing those things that made our nation a failure?
It is no longer a news how important it is to do the things that will save the unity of our nation Nigeria.
It is surprising that the enemies of democracy who on their own brought in policies that caused our present situation are those who showcase themselves as the messiah that Nigeria look up to, a nation that has twenty million people.

Government of Nigeria have exonerated themselves from the meeting between investors and ministers held in America

Yemi Osibanjo is among those whose names are in the book for organising the meeting. 
So many ambassadors of Nigeria who were expected to be in the meeeting organised by Nigeria embassy in Washington DC in America were not present in the event.
The absence of the government officials made the people hopeful that Nigeria will not get loan from overseas. 
Those who were supposed to be present include the vice president Yemi Osibanjo, Minister of finance Kemi Adeosun, Minister of petroleum Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of Agriculture Audu Ogbeh, Minister of technology Ogbonnaya Onu,Minister of Information Lai Mohammed, Minister of Mineral resources Kayode Fayemi and Minister of Commerce Okechukwu Enelamah.

An individual, Sanusi Lamido, the king of Kano and once the governor of central bank of Nigeria, was dissatisfied with the action of the government. 
What Sanusi said
Sanusi said that one who supports investing money in Africa should take Nigeria, Ghana, Ruwanda, Kenya, and South Africa.
He went further to say 'Nigeria maybe better than others in trading but an investor may say, instead of investing $500 in Nigeria let him invest $100 in Ghana, $100 in Ruwanda, $100 in Coted'Ivoire to get robust gain.
We went to have a meeting with foreign investors, we were supposed to start by 9 o'clock but started by 10 o'clock.
When I got to that place, they took m to the office of the Nigeria Ambassador.
Those who came for the meeting were there, the Vice president was absent, the Ministers were absent, said Sanusi.
Sanusi said that what they did was not good, because it showed that Nigeria was not yet prepared for what was being talked about. 
He said 'You called people to come and hear how trading is done in Nigeria but you did not come. '
This is not how to get people that will invest in Nigeria.
If it were to be Ruwandans that organised this meeting, their president, Paul Kagame would be there telling the people to start coming to Ruwanda.
People lent their voices on social media
The owner of the handle @SegunAndrews agreed to what Sanusi said.
But, the government have denied that it was not how the thing happened.

Mohammed explained that the ministers whose names were in this event did not receive invitation to come, or were in Washington DC when this meeting was going on.

Three things single exchange rate will cause
IMF told Nigeria to harmonize its exchange rate to a single price, while professionals are talking of disadvantages of having more than one exchange price.
Naira
EFCC said that Umar wants ten million naira.
To have a steady exchange rate, IMF has advised Nigeria to harmonize its exchange rate to a single price.
Nigeria has at least five exchange rates: one for petroleum exporters in Nigeria, one for Muslim faithful going for Mecca in Saudi Arabia, one for Christians going for Pilgrimage, another for those studying overseas and one fixed by government. 
Property experts Pat Utomi and Uche Uwaleke explained to BBC journalists that it is disadvantageous to have many exchange rates.
These are some of the disadvantages of many exchange rates
It causes soiling of the hands 
Pat Utomi explained that it causes favouritism as it gives someone who knows those in charge the opportunity to buy money at a cheaper rate while another who does not have such opportunity but needs the money to import materials for production of goods will not get it.
It is not good for the progress of buying and selling. 
Where Abacha's money will go into
Money exchange: Has the exchange of dollar for naira reduced
In his words, Uche Uwaleke gave an analogy saying 'As government exchange rate is N305, if it is sold to someone at that rate, that person may sold it to another at N365, thereby making profit. But if there is a single fixed rate, you cannot resale it.'
It kills the spirit of productivity in a nation.
Uwaleke said that multiple exchange rate causes many to be lazy.
The only thing they will do is to engage in the sale of low exchange, there will be no productivity. 
It lowers multiplication of wealth in a nation. 
Utomi said 'if people get foreign exchange at cheaper rate to send their children overseas for study, it will make everybody to want to send their children overseas and the schools in our country will suffer.
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about stopping them
Ekweremadu hid his wealth 
Ekweremadu was again charged for peace in Nigeria.
There are 109 senators, if 108 senators are in Ekweremadu's house now, it means that all of them are in his house.
Remember that the Senate resolved today that security agents should immediately leave the deputy senate president's house, where they attacked him today.
Ekweremadu was blocked from leaving his house this morning, which stopped him from attending today's Senate meeting, where 14 senators defected from APC to PDP.
Uche Anichukwu, Ekweremadu's spokesperson, told BBC Igbo that it was EFCC that blocked him from leaving his house in Abuja, not DSS as was formerly written by us. 
@MrBanksOmishore, Special Assistant to Saraki, this morning wrote the message EFCC sent to Ekweremadu on Twitter.
In that message, EFCC said that they want to probe Ekweremadu for planning to use his position to manipulate carrying out of the country called money laundering in English. 
When Saraki entered the Senate building and started plenary, he said that Ekweremadu could not come, and said that they should strive to see that democracy did not die.
Senator Sam Anyanwu said that he was with Ekweremadu yesterday but he did not get a warrant of being wanted by the police.
After the plenary, the senators resolved that the security agents should leave the house of the Deputy Senate President to enable him utilize the authority due to him.
This morning, Saraki is among those blocked from leaving their houses.
On the other hand, Nigeria President, Muhammadu Buhari thanked those that defected from APC today and wished them well.
He said this through His Twitter handle, @MBuhari.
EFCC blocked Ekweremadu's door in Abuja.
Television was showing EFCC's gun pointing at the front of Ekweremadu's house. 
Those who kidnapped and killed a Catholic priest have been sentenced to death.
High court has sentenced those who kidnapped and killed Father John Adeyi to death by hanging.
Court has given order to hang the criminals. 
High court in Makurdi, Benue state, have decided to hang two people, Hartuna Idi and Suleiman Gina, who are the remnant of those who kidnapped and killed Father John Adeyi till they died for what they committed. 
Remember that four kidnappers which include Saidu Abdullahi and Aliyu Garba kidnapped Father Adeyi, the Vicar-General of Catholic church in Otukpo Diocese, Benue state, killed him and dumped his corpse in a farm near Otukpo in 2016.
What I experienced from kidnappers.
Mikel Obi's father has been redeemed from kidnappers again.
But the police later arrested four of them, they confessed that they collected N1.7m ransom but they shot him to death when they heard that the villagers were coming to redeem him from their captivity. 
One of them confessed that he was the one that shot him to death. The remaining two were sentenced to death today being Wednesday. 
In the message the family of the priest sent to Daily Post, they expressed their gratitude that at the end they got justice. 
But they grieved that the judgement reminded them of the murder of Adeyi, who was a professor. 
The Senate have ran to Ekweremadu. 
Saraki and Ekweremadu: What people are saying about their blockage.
APC pay for their autocratic leadership--Expert
There is a spirit living in a child that is born with dreads.
What the Igbo culture said about dreads in the ancient time and views about it presently. 
In the ancient time, Igbo believed that people with dreads could do magic.
The cry of a new born baby in every house brings happiness to the heart of everyone 
But there are some places in Igbo land where a new born baby with dreads may bring fear.
In a place like Igbuzo (Ibusa) in Delta state, where the people see children with dreads as special people 
Who is someone with dreads?
Some stories said that a new born baby with dreads is because its mother prayed to one spirit living on earth to give her a child.
Will you have the type of circumcision had in the ancient time?
Do you know the God the Igbos worshipped in the ancient time?
They believe that dreads is a mark given to the child for recognition 
They call the children child-king
They believe that their dreads is their crown.
As they believe, a child with dreads will do wonderfully well in life because his God is strongly by him, they are quite strong, and they grow to be brave that cause terror in time of war.
But many problems accompany those that carry dreadsmen.
It is difficult to take very good care of dreads.
Dreads goes acredness
Many of the villagers believe that a child with dreads encounters many sicknesses or dies when a comb goes into the dreads.
It is an abomination to touch the hair of someone with dreads.
Whoever does something like this shall give the child money immediately or tie a Cowrie on the hair. 
It is only this that will stop the child from falling sseverely ill. 
It is only the mother of the child that can touch the dreads.
The tradition of cutting dreads
Story has it that it is only herbalists can cut the hair of a child with dreads. 
Now celebrities and so many other people use dreads for fashion.
The must have grown and be talking.
His/her family will ask him/her what he/she wants as a gift item to cut the dreads. 
Whatever he/she wants that day is what they will give him/her.
Christianity
The whole Igbo land is a place where Christian faith is very strong.
This has caused change in many Igbo culture 
Now many Igbos do not believe that bad spirit lives in any child that is born into this world with dreads. 
But they still take this kind of child to the church for priests to pray for him/her.
Doctor Anthony Mgbolu told BBC Igbo that dreads are from family generation 
What Igbo culture explained about people with dreads. 
An expe in the study of Africa and language in the University of Lagos Chiagozie Nnabuihe explained to BBC Igbo that Igbo land in the ancient time did not have any belief about people with dreads
Nnabuihe strongly affirmed that if Igbos in the ancient time had believed in dreads, they would given it a name
In his words, 'Dada' is a Yoruba term for dreads.
That the Igbos revere dreads is because they have had contact with the Yorubas.
But are dreads really bad thing?
Nnamdi Daniels is a performer 
Many people we interviewed said that there is nothing really bad in dreads, but many people still see those with dreads as people with bad character. 
Nnamdi Daniels, a man with dreads, told BBC Igbo that he has seen hell from the myriads of insult to him because of his dreads. 
He said 'I remember when I travelled to Niger state University 
A security agent began to ask me surprising questions because of my dreads. This brought me a big shame'

The Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, said this when the committee set up by his ministry to look into the problem of codiene came to show him their findings.
He also said that this is to show that government are firm in their resolution to ban codiene medicine in Nigeria. 
Banning of codiene: the price for cough medicine has increased 
NAFDAC has lifted the ban on Emzor and others.
Adewole said that his ministry and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control collaborated in this wiping off
Remember that in May this year, BBC showed on television the havoc codiene cough syrup was causing in Nigeria. 
It was when this was shown that the government said that they will ban the buying and drinking of this cough syrup. 
The government are saying that they are still looking into other cough syrups with destructive effects.

Leprosy
Swollen stomach
Drop st
Hernia

Anybody with these sicknesses should totally confess the wrongs done before he/she dies.
If he/she did not confess the sins committed, they would excommunicate him/her In the evil forest. 
Do you know the God worshipped by the Igbos in the ancient time?
The things that should not be done around an Igbo person
Other things like committing adultery with another's husband or wife, or giving birth to twins and incurable sickness may cause the land to curse that person

Like Nnabuihe explained, excommunication of that person is in older to save his children and family.

Igbo Tradition: The reason for marrying a woman's corpse in Igbo land.
Most times people ask the reason behind marrying a woman's corpse in some areas of Igbo land, this story explained it.
A man and a woman in union
Igbo does not support cohabitation without marriage. 
Most often there are news of youths who love themselves, and agreed to live together as husband and wife without fulfilling the cultural demands for marriage. 
Sometimes unforseen circumstances arise in this situation, especially the woman dieing in the man's house when the cultural marriage rites were not performed.
Women's title in Igbo land
Five things that interest women
Is 'Omugwo' a tradition to abolish in Igbo land?
However, this causes confusion in different families. 
Because of this bad condition, many villages in Igbo land, made it a law that a man will marry the corpse of a woman whom he was living with him without paying the complete dowry
The reason for marrying a woman's corpse. 
Igbo land, a man is not married unless he paid the woman's dowry.
If even he married in court, he is expected to go to the woman's family and do things as they want.
Like an expert in culture, Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (Duruagwu the second) of Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State, told BBC Igbo, this law is very potent in their village, it goes different punishments. 
He who does not marry alive, marries in death, is the system most villages adopted.
But in Akokwa village also in Imo State, this thought is not potent at all, where the woman's family come and take the corpse of their daughter home for burial. 
The system for marrying a woman's corpse 
The man will first come and told the family that their daughter is sick (he will not tell them that she is dead at first).
They will follow him to visit their daughter, when they have seen her, they will accuse the man of killing their daughter, and the man will start denying it.
To prove that he did not kill her he would agree to marry the woman's corpse. 
He will come and marry it.
He would come back and tell the family that their daughter has died.
The man will proceed to do her burial ceremony 
What will happen to who refused marrying a woman's corpse 
Like Nze Ukaejuoha explained, these are what will befall who refused to marry a woman he did not pay her dowry at death
That person would receive different punishments 
He will also be met with different bad things.
Things will not go well with such a person.
That person may also die a miserable death.
But such person may repent, most especially when all these things started befalling him.
What that person will do when he repents
If that man was stubborn but later repented because of the problems he was getting, these are the things he will do: 
That person will send the elders of his village to pacify the land
He would be punished by doing all he should do in double folds.
Nigeria 2019 elections: characteristics of those contesting presidency -Muhammadu Buhari 
The Nigeria President, Muhammadu Buhari is vying presidency the second term in democracy dispensation under the ruling party.
President Muhammadu Buhari 
President Muhammadu Buhari is presently seeking vote to be Nigeria's president the third time.

When he was ruling as a soldier, Buhari was not known for respecting human right.

This man at age 76 took oath of service in 2015, and promised that he will fight corruption and insurgency, and improvement of Niger's economy. 
Four years is elapsing but many people do not agree that he has made any remarkable achievements.
He promised to defeat Boko Haram in the war Nigeria fights against the sect that wants an Islamic state in Northern Nigeria, but presently, this sect torments this intention of Buhari through its invasion of this area.
Prominent individuals believe that Buhari will face strong contest with a more prominent non-ruling. The flag bearer of PDP, Atiku Abubakar is also an Islam from Northern Nigeria like Buhari. 
Buhari, the flag bearer of All Progressive Congress (APC) is known to be upright among Nigerian politicians, despite that some see his campaign as waste of resources.

Those who sell preventive drugs should not sell to anyone who does not have a written note from his/her doctor 
It is also necessary to do culture and sensitivity tests before giving preventive drugs to someone. 
Whoever that is sick should go to a hospital for a test for drugs to be prescribed for him/her. 
Health workers should explain to people how important it is to know how to take these preventive drugs.

INEC said that the names of those that registered for 2019 elections are in their computer.
Festus Okoye and Emeka Unachukwu 
INEC messenger Festus Okoye strongly says that the commission does not have server that will give them opportunity to transmit the result of 2019 elections. 
Okoye said that Nigeria constitution does not permit them to do that. 
Justice Garba has taken over the case between Atiku and Buhari.
National Assembly have approved the 2019 budget.
In his speech, 'Nigeria constitution gave provision to carry all the results of elections in Form EC8A at hand to collation centres of their wards. 
The Nigeria constitution we used for the elections does not know the use of computer to send any message.
It is the duty of the collation officers to carry the papers to where they are needed by hand. 
There was never a time we used computer to send election results.
Okoye agreed that all who registered their names for 2019 elections are recorded in computer, that all the parties were given the names of those people.
The use of incident form will not stop manipulations going on in election. 
He strongly affirmed 'It is only when computer is used for voting that one would say that something is in the server. 
He said that he does not know about the result of 2019 elections being in the server.
On the same hand, BBC asked a renowned computer operator, Emeka Unachukwu what is server?
Unachukwu said 'Server is a computer that links other computers used for storing different information together.
He said that INEC can say that they don't have server because there is another office storing data for them but it is not true that they don't have server since they have data. 
He said that the internet has its own server where many people keep their information. 
Unachukwu said 'INEC cannot say that don't have because they have where they store data.
They may call this data base but it is server because that computer unites others together which can receive from or send message to it.'
He said it is difficult for INRC to say they don't have server. 
If they are calling people to come and collect their PVCs they should be ready for elections. 
Unachukwu said that even if voting was done and transmitted manually to where it was counted, INEC will still put it in the server.
But they can say they have not keyed the result of 2019 election in the server which shows that they have not finished their work.
